HISTORICAL SKETCH
W
ELLESLEY COLLEGE is one of that group of women's colleges estab-
lished in the nineteenth century to offer to young women the edu-
cational opportunities "equivalent to those usually provided in colleges
for young men.” The motive of its founder, Henry Fowle Durant, was,
however, something more than the enrichment of the experience of
young women for their own sake. Addressing the first students in the
fall of 1875 he said, “You mistake altogether the significance of the
movement of which you are a part if you think this is simply a question
of a college education for girls. I believe that God's hand is in it; ...
that He is calling to womanhood to come up higher, to prepare herself
for great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life, for noblest usefulness."
To the end of preparing women for positions of responsibility, Mr.
Durant insisted from the beginning on the maintenance of high aca-
demic standards, and of healthy community life in beautiful surround-
ings. He built an impressive College Hall on his own spacious estate
fourteen miles west of Boston, and spared no pains to make his gift con-
tribute to the aesthetic development of students. He began to beautify
the four hundred acre campus which has become one of Wellesley's dis-
tinctive assets. He encouraged the inclusion in the student body of rep-
resentatives from all parts of the country and from foreign lands. He
placed more emphasis on personal quality than on the accident of eco-
nomic status, and he maintained a real democracy within the college
family. He opened unusual professional opportunities to women on
the faculty. He introduced laboratory work in science before it was
widely recognized as academically necessary. He recognized the sig-
nificance of the arts in education and encouraged "learning by doing.”
He assumed that religion was a normal part of the life of educated peo-
ple and made provision for its study and expression in the program of
the new community.
From the beginning the Board of Trustees has been composed of men
and women whose interests have been far-reaching in New England and
around the world. The first board included the President of Yale Col-
lege, Chancellor of the University of the City of New York, Dean of the
Episcopal Theological School of Harvard University, President of Bos-
ton University, a professor of the Rochester Theological Seminary and
of Andover Theological Seminary, two pastors, and a former Governor
of Massachusetts. The roster has been continuously noteworthy for the
calibre of the persons who have contributed of their time, their profes-
sional experience, their money to strengthen the College. The present
board includes educators as well as financiers, lawyers, an architect,
22
HISTORICAL SKETCH
23
a doctor, businessmen--men and women of wide cultural interests se-
lected for their expert contribution. It is a working board. Three of
its regular members are nominated by vote of the Alumnae Association.
An unusual feature of organization is the membership of a “faculty
trustee" who is not a member of the faculty but is nominated by the Aca-
demic Council.
The history of the College falls into two fairly distinct periods, pre-
and post-College Hall Fire. The College was chartered on March 17,
1870, but the planning of the program and the construction of College
Hall required five years of effort and the opening did not occur until
September, 1875. In a surprisingly short period, under the leadership
of President Ada Howard (1875-1881) and Alice Freeman (1881–1887),
the institution became established as a well-known college. It bor-
rowed ideas and methods from various institutions, notably Mount
Holyoke Seminary's program of domestic work for each student. It
drew heavily on Harvard University resources but at once assumed re-
sponsibility for copying nothing blindly and for introducing a type of
instruction which put much initiative upon students.
During the presidencies of Helen Shafer (1887–1894) and Julia Irvine
(1894–1899) the present curriculum of the College took shape and the
experimental venture in higher education for women became estab-
lished as a permanent part of the educational scene. President Caro-
line Hazard (1899-1910) brought to the academically mature College
the graciousness of the artist. Music, art, gracious living were re-
emphasized as important factors in a community of educated people.
On the night of March 17, 1914, College Hall burned to the ground.
The orderly evacuation of the building with no injury to any occupant
won world-wide fame for the already well-known College. In the
emergency created by this catastrophe President Ellen Fitz Pendleton
(1911-1936) came to the position of leadership which made her indeed
the builder which she will always be in the grateful memory of Welles-
ley women. Within twenty-five years the College grew from an in-
adequately housed, financially handicapped institution to a beautifully
equipped and well-endowed college. More significantly, Miss Pendle-
ton guided the reorganization of the faculty into a democratically con-
trolled policy-making body which worked consistently to maintain and
develop a vital curriculum and community life. She assisted in the for-
mation of a vigorous Alumnae Association and presided over the mag-
nificent efforts of the trustees and alumnae to raise enough money to
rebuild, expand, and endow the College.
During the very years of Wellesley's urgent need, the efforts of all
its members were directed to the war service of four overseas units.
Wellesley is no "ivory tower" to which people withdraw from contact
24
HISTORICAL SKETCH
with world needs. Her fourteen thousand alumnae, engaged in every
kind of responsible task, prove that fact. The register of graduates lists
Wellesley women living in each of the forty-eight states of the United
States of America and in forty-eight foreign lands.
Through the years the external aspects of Wellesley College have
changed almost completely. It started with three hundred students,
most of them in a preparatory department which was a part of the Col-
lege until 1879. It has become a college for fifteen hundred students,
with fifty or sixty graduate students. Starting with one building, it now
has forty-seven. It began with Mr. Durant's private library of less than
10,000 volumes. Its present library has outgrown the building de-
signed to accommodate 135,000 volumes and has over 200,000 spread
over the campus in a series of departmental units. Its one gymnasium
room has been replaced by two large buildings to provide instructional
and recreational facilities for the Graduate Department of Hygiene and
Physical Education as well as the enlarged undergraduate group.
Through the years the methods of the founder and his wife have
changed to meet new conditions, modified under the leadership of a dis-
tinguished group of men and women, but the fundamental purposes
continue to direct the modern Wellesley which still uses Mr. Durant's
chosen motto, “Non ministrari sed ministrare.”
ADMISSION
YANDIDATES for the Bachelor of Arts degree may qualify for adınission
to Wellesley College either as members of the freshman class, or as
students with advanced standing who present records from accredited
colleges. Since the size of the student body is limited to about fifteen
hundred students, candidates in both groups are chosen very carefully
in order of the excellence of their credentials, which include testimonials
concerning health, character, and scholarship.
APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION
Forms of application will be furnished on request. An application
fee of $10 is required of all applicants and no registration is recorded
until the fee is received. If the candidate cancels her registration or
does not enter the College for any reason, the fee is not refunded, but it
may be transferred to apply to a later year if the request for the transfer
is received within a reasonable time after the beginning of the year for
which the candidate is registered to enter college.
Application for admission to the College may be made to the Chair-
man of the Board of Admission at any time up to March 1 of the year
of entrance. A student is advised to make application at the begin-
ning of her secondary school course and she is urged to do so not later
than the fall of her junior year in secondary school so that her plan of
admission may be approved before it is too late to make schedule
changes. Since rooms are assigned according to the date of applica-
tion, there is an added advantage in early registration.
All communications concerning admission should be addressed to the
Chairman of the Board of Admission, Wellesley College, Wellesley,
Massachusetts.
HEALTH CERTIFICATES
A report from the applicant's physician showing that she is organi-
cally sound and in good health, together with a certificate of vaccina-
tion and any required tests, must be filed with the Board of Admission
before April 1 of the year in which admission is sought. The College
reserves the right to reject any candidate who, in the opinion of the
college physicians, is not fitted for work in the college community.
ADMISSION TO THE FRESHMAN CLASS
Through its admission procedure, the College tries to select students
with good intellectual ability, adequate preparation for further study,
genuine interest in some of the courses offered at Wellesley College,
25
26
ADMISSION
and a purpose which will give incentive to steady work. In making
its selection of students, the Board of Admission reviews school records
and recommendations, entrance examinations, psychological and
scholastic aptitude tests, and information from the candidate concern-
ing her interests and plans of study. From a large number of appli-
cants the freshman class of about four hundred is chosen by the Board.
Students who are interested in admission should read carefully the rec-
ommendations concerning secondary school subjects to be offered for
entrance and the statement concerning the required College Board
tests.
Admission SUBJECTS
Wellesley College is interested in having students from widely scat-
tered geographical centers and from schools of varying types. For
this reason the plan of entrance is flexible so far as the character of the
entrance units is concerned. The plan of entrance units should be con-
sidered in connection with the requirements for the B.A. degree in
Wellesley which are described on pages 33 to 35.
The College recommends the plan of admission units outlined below
as a generally satisfactory basis for work in college. Students whose
work does not follow this pattern are referred to the statement which
follows the description of this plan.
English
4 units
Foreign Language
5 units
Latin or Greek
3 units
A modern language: French, German, Italian,
Spanish .
2 units
History
1 unit
Mathematics
3 units
Algebra
2 units
Plane Geometry
1 unit
Science
1 unit
Elective Subjects .
2 units
This plan allows every student two elective units for additional work in
the fields which she believes have greatest value for her. In the elec-
tive group the College will accept additional units in any of the subjects
listed above, or in art, inusic, Biblical history, and the social sciences
besides history. Students interested primarily in languages, literature,
and the arts are advised to offer for admission four units of Latin and
two units of history, including one of European history.
A student whose course differs from the recommended one, either in
the distribution of subjects or in the number of units in a given subject,
will be considered for admission provided that her whole program in-
ADMISSION
27
cludes sixteen units and offers a sound basis for college work. Students
are urged to discuss their plans of work early in the sccondary school
course with their school advisers and to confer also with the Wellesley
College Board of Admission. The Board will welcome from school
principals information about unusual curricular plans or courses which
the schools recommend to their college groups.
The decision of the Board of Admission concerning a candidate will
in all cases depend on the general excellence of her school record and
recommendations and on her relative standing in the required entrance
tests.
School RECORDS
Complete records of a student's work in secondary school are required.
Blanks for the preliminary records are sent to school principals in the
spring, a year in advance of the student's completion of preparatory
work. Blanks for supplementary records are sent during the year of
final preparation for college.
The school record must be supplemented by statements from the
school principals, concerning the special abilities and interests of the
student, power of sustained work, good health habits, integrity, sense of
responsibility, coöperativeness, initiative and self-reliance in work and
in social action. The College wishes to be informed of circumstances
which may have furthered or interfered with a student's work and of
special honors and accomplishments during the student's secondary
school course.
ENTRANCE TESTS
In addition to presenting complete school records, all candidates for
admission to the freshman class of Wellesley College in 1943 must take
the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which includes both verbal and mathe-
matical sections, and three one-hour Achievement Tests of the College
Entrance Examination Board. One of the three Achievement Tests
must be the English Essay Test, and the other two should be in subjects
in two of these fields: foreign languages, sciences, social studies. All
the Achievement Tests, other than the English Test, are objective tests,
and they are given in French, German, Latin, Spanish, Biology, Chem-
istry, Physics, Social Studies, and Spatial Relations. A student who
has a special reason for wishing to substitute the Spatial Relations Test
for one in the recommended fields should obtain the approval of the
Wellesley College Board of Admission before taking the test. The
required English Test is a test in composition, not literature.
It is recommended that the Scholastic Aptitude Test be taken in
June of the junior year in secondary school and the Achievement Tests
28
ADMISSION
in April of the senior year. A student who does not apply for admis-
sion to the College until her senior year will take all the tests in April.
The advantage of taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test at the end of the
junior year is that the candidate will have an opportunity to repeat the
test if her rating is not satisfactory. The Board of Admission places con-
siderable reliance on this test in making its decision upon an application.
Attention should be called to the fact that the April tests are de-
signed to be taken in stride without special preparation and without
speeding up the school program. In evaluating the ratings made on
the Achievement Tests, the Board of Admission takes into account the
number of years a student has studied a subject and the year in which
she studied it.
Although the Regents examinations of New York State and the ma-
triculation examinations taken by candidates from Canadian or foreign
schools are no longer accepted as substitutes for College Board tests, the
grades made in these tests will appear on a student's record and if they
are good they will count in the candidate's favor. A rating of less than
75 per cent on a Regents examination is considered unsatisfactory by
the College.
GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING TESTS
The College Entrance Examination Board will administer the fol-
lowing three series of tests in 1943:
April Series
Saturday, April 10—Scholastic Aptitude Test (including a mathematical
section)
Achievement Tests (not more than three of the ten which are given may
be taken).

ADMISSION TO ADVANCED STANDING
TERMS OF ADMISSION
The number of students admitted to advanced standing in any year
is limited and all entrance is on a selective basis. If a student has
maintained an excellent record in college and has special interests
which she can follow at Wellesley College, the Board of Admission en-
courages her to apply for entrance with advanced standing credit.
For information about registration candidates should read page 25.
A candidate should show that she has had the background of work
recommended for admission to the freshman class (see page 26) and
has completed at least a full year of highly satisfactory work at another
college. She should be entitled to honorable dismissal from the college
which she has attended and should be recommended by her instructors.
The Board of Admission will give information about the colleges and
universities from which credits are accepted.
All candidates for admission to advanced standing are required to
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test of the College Entrance Examina-
tion Board. A candidate who has never taken this test is advised to
take it in April. For information concerning the test, see page 27.
Residence of at least two years is required to obtain the B.A. degree,
of which one must be the senior year. The work of these two years
must include all the prescribed work (see page 34) not covered by the
credentials submitted, and such courses as are needed to meet the re-
quirements for distribution and concentration (see page 34). Credit
ADMISSION
31
will be tentatively granted early in the first year of residence. The
final determination of credit is not made until the end of the first year
since the success of advanced standing candidates with work at Wellesley
is an important consideration in deciding upon credit.
The selection of applicants for admission with advanced standing
will be made in July of the year in which entrance is desired.

ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE M.A. AND M.S.
DEGREES
Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Educa-
tion, or Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education must be
graduates of Wellesley College or of other institutions of satisfactory
standing, and must present adequate credentials signifying their ability
to carry on the work for the degree.
Application for admission as a graduate student in any department
should be made upon forms which will be furnished by the Dean of
Graduate Students on request. It is desirable that the application be
sent by March first of the year in which the student proposes to enter.
32
ADMISSION
It should be accompanied (1) by the official record of courses and
grades, (2) by a copy of the catalogue of the institution attended,
marked to indicate the courses taken.
Graduate scholarships are described on page 190.
For requirements for the M.A. and M.S. degrees see page 38. A cir-
cular containing full information for graduate students will be sent on
application to the Dean of Graduate Students.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE CERTIFICATE IN HYGIENE
AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION
A two years' course, especially designed for the training of teachers
of hygiene and physical education, and leading to the certificate of the
Department of Hygiene and Physical Education, is offered to gradu-
ates of approved colleges who meet the requirements. Full informa-
tion will be found on page 112.
Correspondence should be addressed to the Dean of Graduate
Students.
DEGREES
The following degrees are conferred by the Trustces upon recom-
mendation of the Academic Council:
Bachelor of Arts.
Master of Arts.
Master of Arts in Education.
Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education.
Certificate in Hygiene and Physical Education.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.A. DEGREE
In constructing the curriculum of which the requirements are given below,
the faculty was guided by a belief that a student's four years in college should
give her several specific sorts of training. The prescribed work is planned to
assure her possession of certain skills which are of general use, and to add to
the information which she has acquired before coming to college further in-
formation considered of fundamental importance. Thus the prescribed work
in English Composition and Speech is designed to assure her having accuracy
and effectiveness in speaking and writing English. The prescription in Hy-
giene affords the student a knowledge of the laws of health. The prescribed
work in Biblical History gives a knowledge of the historical basis of Christianity.
The requirement of work for distribution is made with the purpose of securing
for each student some acquaintance with methods of work and ways of thinking
in various representative fields of knowledge. The requirement of work for con-
centration is made in order that the student shall make a reasonably thorough
study of one field of knowledge. The curriculum is so planned that a student
has the opportunity to elect without restriction a number of courses to suit her
individual need and interest.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must complete before graduation
the equivalent of one hundred and twenty semester hours, and have
in addition a reading knowledge of one of the following: French, Ger-
man, Greek, Italian, Latin, Spanish.
The examination to test the reading knowledge of one of these for-
eign languages will be given at the beginning of each semester. In
general the choice of the language to be offered is left to the student,
but any department offering work for a major may require its major
students to pass the examination in one particular language or in one
of any two or more specified languages. A student should therefore
consult the department in which she may wish to major before planning
to take her examination in a particular language. Students majoring
in a foreign language will be tested in a reading knowledge of a second
language; in this case students may postpone the examination until the
beginning of the senior year.
Of the one hundred and twenty semester hours required for the B.A.
degree a certain number is prescribed; a certain number must be elected

to fulfill the requirements of work for distribution and work for concentra-
tion; the rest is free elective.
I. PRESCRIBED. The following subjects are required as specified:
Biblical History (in the sophomore year)

Of the required subjects, English Composition, six hours, must be taken in
the freshman year; Hygiene and Physical Education three hours in the freshman
year, and one hour in the sophomore year; Biblical History, six hours, in the
sophomore year; Speech, two hours, before the junior year.
II. WORK FOR DISTRIBUTION. Twelve hours in addition to the pre-
scribed work, to be elected in each of the three groups given below.
The twelve hours in each of the three groups are to be elected so as to fall
six hours in one department and six hours in one or two other depart-
ments. Only one beginning course in a modern language may be
counted for distribution.
Group I. Art, English Composition, English Literature, French, Ger-
man, Greek, Italian, Latin, Music, Spanish, Speech.
Group II. Biblical History, Economics, Education, History, Philosophy,
Political Science, Psychology, Sociology.
Group III. Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Geology and Geography,
Mathematics, Physics, Zoology and Physiology.
Every freshman must take for distribution six hours in each of two groups;
and every student is required to have had by the end of her sophomore year at
least six hours counting for distribution in each group.
III. WORK FOR CONCENTRATION. Forty-two semester hours in one
field of concentration, of which a major of twenty-four to thirty hours
shall be in one department, and eighteen to twelve hours shall be in
courses related or supplementary to the major but falling in one or more
departments other than that in which the major is taken. I
* If a student fails to pass with a grade of at least C in the second semester of
English Composition 101, she will be required to take an additional semester course
in the sophomore year.
† These two hours in Hygiene and Physical Education are met by four periods in
practical work, two periods per week in the freshman year and two in the sophomore
year.
$ In the interpretation of this requirement the departments of Geology and Geog-
raphy, English Composition and English Literature shall count in each case as two
departments.
DEGREES
35
All courses are classified in grades I, II, III; grade I indicating cle-
mentary courses and grade III the most advanced courses. Of the
courses offered to fulfill the requirement of work for concentration at least
six hours of grade III must be taken in the senior year. Of the forty-
two hours required at least eighteen hours must be above grade I and
at least twelve hours must be of grade III.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must pass a general examination in a
major subject in addition to the regular course examinations.
COURSE EXAMINATIONS
An examination period occurs at the end of each semester. Exami-
nations for the removal of conditions and deficiencies and for advanced
standing may be taken during any examination period and at other
specified times.
A student who wishes to take an examination upon a course which is
not a part of her approved schedule for the year, must apply to the
College Recorder for the requisite card of admission to the examination.
STANDARD FOR GRADUATION
A certain quality grade is required for graduation and, for the pur-
pose of determining this quality grade, numerical values called "points"
are given to the grade letters as follows: for grade A, three points for
each semester hour of the course in which the grade is received; for
grade B, two points; for grade C, one point; for grade D (passing), no
points; for a grade below D, no points and not counted in hours toward
a degree. In order to be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of
Arts a student must in each semester attain as many quality points as
the hours she carries, i.e., a credit ratio of 1.0. (The credit ratio is the
ratio of the number of quality points earned to the semester hours
carried.) Deficiency of points in any semester may be made good only
in accordance with regulations adopted by the faculty. In general,
students who are deficient in quality points at the end of the third year
or who are otherwise not of diploma-grade standing will not be per-
mitted to continue.
The College reserves the right to require the withdrawal of students
whose academic standing is not satisfactory, and of those who for any
other reason have shown themselves to be not in accord with the ideals
and standards which the College seeks to maintain.
HONORS IN A SPECIAL FIELD
Recognition of the desire of certain students to carry on consecutive
and somewhat intensive work along the line of their particular interests
has led to the introduction of a plan for Honors in a Special Field.
36
DEGREES
A student electing to study for Honors will choose a Field of Special
Study and will work in that field under the direction of one or more of
the instructors concerned who will advise her on the possible develop-
ment of her field and will guide her in the carrying on of independent
work within it.
Students who wish to become candidates for Honors may apply in
the spring of their sophomore or junior year to the committee appointed
to consider these applications.
DEPARTMENTAL HONORS
A plan for Departmental Honors has been established to enable cer-
tain students to enrich the work of the major subject by engaging in a
program of supplementary directed work in the senior year.
A can-
didate for Departmental Honors will carry a normal senior program
supplemented by work in the major subject done under the special di-
rection of one or more instructors. The supplementary work will be
planned to suit the needs and interests of the individual student.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELECTING COURSES
The program in the freshman year is as follows:
English Composition 101.
6 hours
Hygiene 120
2 hours
Hygiene 121 (practical work 2 hours)
1 hour
Electives, 4 six-hour courses
24 hours
Total.
33 hours
The courses must be chosen in accordance with the prerequisites
given in the department statements from the list of courses named be-
low, with the provision that one course must be chosen from each of two
of the three groups described below. It is unwise to include two begin-
ning courses in modern language.

If thirty-three hours are satisfactorily completed in the freshman year,
the normal program for the remaining years would be as follows:
Sophomore year.
33 hours
Junior year
30
24
Senior year
If thirty-three hours are not completed in both the freshman and
sophomore years, it will be necessary for a student to attend summer
school or to carry more hours in the junior and senior years than speci-
fied above, subject to certain regulations.
Elective courses must be chosen with great care so that changes will
not be necessary. Students are held responsible for observing the
requirements for the degree and the proper sequence of courses.
Students, except entering freshmen, arc required to choose in the
spring their electives for the year following. All requests for changes of
elective courses should be sent in time to reach the College before
August 15.
PRE-PROFESSIONAL COURSES
Students who plan to apply for admission to professional schools after
leaving Wellesley College should consult their class deans about ap-
propriate electives early in the course.
Each student who is planning to study medicine is advised to confer
with her class dean before the beginning of her sophomore year.
ing students are advised to elect two pre-medical sciences in the fresh-
man year. In general, requirements for adınission to medical schools
of Class A can be met by eighteen hours in Chemistry and twelve hours
in Physics and Zoölogy respectively, but each student is advised to study
carefully the requirements for the particular school which she has
chosen. Attention is called to the fact that twenty-four hours are re-
quired as a basis for the general examination in any department. It is,
however, possible to fulfill the minimum requirement for medical
schools, and to take the general examination in an entirely different
field.
Students planning to prepare for work in hospital or public health
laboratories should begin both Chemistry and Zoölogy in their freshman
year in order to have the necessary foundation for advanced courses.
The departments of Botany, Chemistry, Physics, and Zoology should
be consulted concerning combinations of courses in later years of the
college course.
PREPARATION FOR TEACHING
A student wishing special preparation for teaching may plan a five
year integrated course leading to a Bachelor of Arts at the end of the
38
DEGREES
fourth year and a Master of Arts in Education at the end of the fifth.
The courses in a student's field of concentration and her free electives
will be chosen to provide preparation in the subjects which she espe-
cially desires to teach. Her program will include also courses in Edu-
cation which will enable her to meet requirements for certification in
many states. Practice teaching will be included in the work of the
fifth year.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.A. AND M.S. DEGREES
Wellesley College offers graduate work leading to the degrees of
Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Science in
Hygiene and Physical Education. The work required of a candidate is
considered to be the equivalent of twenty-four hours of college work.
In general, a candidate is required to work in one department. The
program includes no fewer than two full courses of Grade III or their
equivalent, and may include a thesis embodying the results of original
research or reports based on independent work. A candidate for a
Master's degree is required to have a working knowledge of either
French or German, to be tested by examination at entrance. Individual
departments may require a second language. At least one year of
graduate study is required of all candidates, but more time may be
needed for the completion of the work. One year in residence is re-
quired of all candidates except graduates of Wellesley College who have
done the work at some institution which does not grant a Master's de-
gree to women.
Information regarding requirements for admission, theses, final ex-
aminations, etc., will be found in the Graduate Circular which will be
sent on application to the Dean of Graduate Students.
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
1942-43
HE following courses of instruction are offered by the several de-
of any course not chosen by at least six students.
All courses are classified in grades I, II, III; grade I indicating ele-
mentary courses and grade III the most advanced courses. Grade I
courses are numbered 101, etc.; grade II courses 201, etc.; grade III
courses 301, etc.

Many of the courses in Art include some laboratory work in the one or more
mediums with which the course is concerned. The department believes that
laboratory training has great value in developing observation and understand-
ing of problems of art, and for this reason requires it of majoring students. It
should be stated, however, that no particular natural aptitude is required and
that the work is scaled to the student's ability.

may take
GENERAL EXAMINATION
Students will be expected to show a knowledge of the Bible as a whole,
especially as a record of religious thought and development, and to
relate this knowledge to the material of other courses taken.
Such questions of minute detail concerning Biblical history, biog-
raphy and literature as might be included in term examinations will
not appear, but it is to be expected that the student will show as basic
to her understanding of religious developments:
1. A broad knowledge of the outlines of the political history involved.
2. A grasp of the principles, procedure and results of historical and
literary criticism.
3. Such a knowledge of the content of the Bible as will make it
possible for her to illustrate concretely her general statements.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
The courses in Botany are intended to present to the general student
a basis for understanding and interpreting the phenomena of the world
of living things and, at the same time, to furnish a foundation for stu-
dents who plan to follow professionally some phase of biological work.
The major in Botany is based on course 101 or on two of the following
courses: 202, 203, 204, 206. The grade III courses, while still empha-
sizing fundamental biological principles, give more specific training in
different phases of botanical science. A variety of sequences of courses
is available. Any member of the department will be glad to talk with
students concerning the department courses and supplementing courses
that will most nearly fill their needs. Those students who are planning
to continue their botanical work after graduation along lines of teaching,
research, agricultural and experiment station work, in various kinds of
technical laboratory work, landscape gardening, horticulture, or mu-
seum work, etc., will find it advisable to discuss their plans with the
department as early as possible in their course.
For students interested in bacteriology, public health work, or medi-
cal laboratory work, 308 and 312 present the basic viewpoints and
60
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
techniques of bacteriology upon which may be added the more tech-
nical training obtainable in graduate or professional schools. Other
courses, such as 304, 306, and 307, in this department, as well as courses
in Chemistry and Zoölogy, supplement these offerings.
Course 350 is open for independent study or advanced work in any
field in which the student has had a grade III course in the department.
Courses 308 and 312 may form a part of a Botany major that includes
a year of grade III other than, or in addition to, 309-310 or 350.
The department offerings in Landscape Design, 309-310, may form
a part of a Botany major that includes a year of grade III other than, or
in addition to, 308 or 312.
Botany majors may, under certain conditions, obtain permission from
the Chemistry department to take Chemistry 301 after having had
Chemistry 101.
The department will accept a reading knowledge of any of the foreign
languages prescribed by the College to fulfill its requirements, but of
these it considers French, German, or Latin to be of special value.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination aims to test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles and the basic facts of plant science and to de-
termine her ability to correlate and utilize this information.
A sufficient number of questions will be given to provide a choice for
every student, no matter what combination of courses she has elected in
her major.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
Members of the department will be glad to advise students concerning
courses (in Chemistry and in related departments) which would best
prepare for teaching, for positions in analytical and research and in-
dustrial laboratories, for work as hospital laboratory technicians,
for public health work, for nursing, or for graduate study.
For any major in Chemistry one of the following sequences of courses
is essential: 101, 201, 202, and 301; or 103, 202, and 301. Any other
courses in the department may be added to these to complete the
twenty-four-hour major.
It is advisable that all students majoring in Chemistry should com-
plete one year of college Physics and one year of college Mathematics,
and acquire a reading knowledge of French and German before the
senior year. They will be required to pass a reading knowledge exami-
nation in German, or French.
Pre-medical students are referred to the requirements as given on
page 37.
For Hospital and Public Health work, students are advised to elect
101 and 201, or 103, 202, 301, 304 and 309.
Seniors electing Chemistry 304 and 309 may, upon the recommenda-
tion of this department, obtain special permission from the Zoology
department to take Physiology (Zoology 308) without prerequisite.
Students intending to use their Chemistry after graduation will be
recommended by the department only if they have completed at least
eighteen hours of Chemistry.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The aim of the general examination in Chemistry will be to test the
student's knowledge of the fundamental principles and important
facts of Chemistry, and her ability to correlate and apply this material.
CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
The departments of Art, Greek, and Latin offer a program of study
constituting a major in Archaeology. The purpose of this major is to
correlate the courses in ancient art with those in Greek and Latin lan-
guage and literature, in order to provide opportunity for a more com-
prehensive study and understanding of ancient civilization than is
available within any one of the separate departments. This major will
also serve as a basic preparation for those students contemplating
graduate and field work in archaeology.
The work for concentration should normally include forty-eight hours
divided as follows: eighteen hours in Art; either eighteen hours in Greek
ECONOMICS
65
and six hours in Latin or cighteen hours in Latin and six in Greek; six
hours in Ancient History (203 or 204). From the courses elected in
Art, Greek, and Latin, thirty hours will be chosen to form the major.
The choice will be made by the student in consultation with the chair-
man in charge of the work in archaeology.
All courses in the Greek and Latin departments may be counted in
the field for concentration, except Greek 203, 204, 207, and Latin 104,
105. In the Art department the following courses may be counted:
101, 209, 314, 318, 320. In addition to these, 350 work may be taken
in any one of the three departments concerned. The complete pro-
gram should include six hours of grade III work in Art and six hours of
grade III work in either Greek or Latin.
Some knowledge of geology is useful for field archaeology; chemistry
is valuable both for field and museum work.
A reading knowledge of French, German, or Italian is required for
this major.
The work of the Archaeology major will be supervised by a joint
committee composed of representatives from the three departments
concerned. Students should have their program approved by the
chairman of this committee who will be Associate Professor Dorothy M.
Robathan for the year 1942–43.
The general examination will cover the thirty hours of work included
in the major. It will be given in two parts, one on art, the other on
language and literature.

Director: LAURA HOOPER, PH.D.
The Anne L. Page Memorial on the college campus is a school for

an early announcement called "a type of progressive education based
on the growth of the child and respect for his personality.” It con-
tinues in that tradition. Students from various departments of the
College are welcomed as observers.
Established for the children of Wellesley, the Anne L. Page Memorial
became a demonstration school for college students as soon as it was
located on its present site in 1913. In 1927 the Nursery School for
children from two to four was founded by the Department of Education.
In 1940 the two schools were combined by extending the scope of the
Anne L. Page Memorial to include the younger children.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
1. MAJOR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
Distribution of work: To insure a desirable distribution of work over
several periods of literary history, students planning majors in English
Literature should make sure that one of their grade III courses studies
a period not previously treated in a course of grade I or grade II.
The following courses in English Literature are not counted in the
major: 210, 212, 213.
Related courses: Related courses for concentration may be chosen from
many fields. Knowledge of at least one foreign literature, and ability
to read certain foreign languages, ancient and modern, is of great value
to the student of English Literature. Understanding of the history of
the periods in which the literature is studied is also important. In
English Composition special attention is called to 201, 208, 303; in the
classical departments, to Greek 203, 204, and Latin 105, dealing with
Greek and Latin literature in translation; in Italian, to 103, Introduc-
tion to the Study of the Italian Renaissance. The attention of students
who are interested in the teaching of English is called to Education 307,
The Teaching of English in the Secondary School,
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
The examination will consist of questions covering the courses in-
cluded in the English Literature major. In this list there will be a
sufficient number of questions to insure a fair opportunity for choice.
Each student will select the questions dealing with the subjects she has
studied in her own major. The questions will seek to test: (1) The
student's knowledge of authors, works, types, and the periods included in
her major; (2) her intelligence and accuracy in correlating her knowl-
edge; (3) her independence of judgment and her literary discrimination.
II. MAJOR IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: English Composition 101 is required of all stu-
dents, but will not be counted as part of the major in Composition. For
a twenty-four-hour major the following combination is recommended:
two or more semester courses of grade II (see restrictions under indi-
vidual courses); twelve hours of grade III (303 is always to be in-
cluded); six hours of grade II or III in English Literature.
Note: Either 301-302 or 304 must be elected in the senior year
in a
twenty-four-hour major. No two writing courses may be taken at the
same time, but English Composition 303 and courses in English Litera-
84
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
ture may be taken simultaneously with a writing course. Courses 209
and 312 in English Literature are also regarded as courses in Composi-
tion.
Related courses: Students intending to teach or to engage in literary
work should include in their program additional courses in Literature
and a course in Language. Some knowledge of Latin and Greek
Literature in the original or in translation is highly important for a
teacher of English, as is a background of History, especially English
History. The attention of students who are interested in the teaching
of English is called to Education 307, The Teaching of English in the
Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
The general examination in English Composition will include ques-
tions on the theory—on the principles of craftsmanship-underlying
the specific courses the student has taken; it will include a study of the
forms of description, narration, and exposition in their general aspects;
a study of differing types of essay, of biography, of criticism; a study of
the historical development of the sentence, of the paragraph, and of the
linguistic elements composing our vocabulary. The student will be
expected to organize her answers clearly and to write with reasonable
fluency and finish. Supplementary reading and detailed instructions
will be given in a department statement to be issued later.
III. JOINT MAJOR IN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: This major consists of twelve hours of English
Composition beyond Composition 101, and eighteen hours of English
Literature. A student may elect further work in either Literature or
Composition, or both, or in some related subject, as part of the forty-
two hours in her field of concentration.
The courses in Composition should include six hours of grade II
and six hours of grade III. Students exempted from Composition
101 at midyears should complete the year with a Composition course of
grade II.
The courses in Literature should include at least six hours of grade
II and six hours of grade III. One of the following courses not counted
in the Literature major—210, 212-may count as part of the joint
major. In general, one of the Literature courses elected should deal
with a period earlier than the nineteenth century.
Related courses: The background of related courses to be desired for
this major is the same as that described under the majors in Literature
and Composition.

processes by which land forms originate and are modified, and the
rocks and minerals of the earth's crust upon which these processes

I. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES *
The Department of Hygiene and Physical Education, through its program
adapted to individual needs and abilities, aims to help each student to build up
sufficient strength and vitality to meet the demands of a normally active life;
to appreciate and practice fundamental health habits; to develop a normal
carriage, a sense of rhythm, coördination and motor judgment; to be a coöpera-
tive and contributing participant in group activity; and to acquire skill and
a lasting interest in wholesome forms of recreation.
Four hours in Hygiene and Physical Education are prescribed for the degree.
Two hours are met by course 120, Personal Hygiene; the other two hours are
met by two periods per week of physical education activities during freshman
and sophomore years. The work of each year is divided into Fall, Winter,
and Spring seasons.
* See Section II, page 112, for opportunities for juniors and seniors to enroll in
professional courses and page 113 for information relative to the five-year course in
Hygiene and Physical Education.
HYGIENE AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION

Sports Requirement: During these six scasons, the department requires that
students take one season of a team sport and two seasons of an individual sport
(not necessarily the same sport). If a student can demonstrate a fair degree of
skill in an individual sport, or if she has a Junior or Senior Life Saving Certifi-
cate, she may substitute other activities for individual sports.
Choices for all activities are subject to the approval of the department, on the
basis of the results of the medical and physical examinations and the student's
previous experience.
Posture Requirement: Every student is expected to attain a grade of at least C
minus on her posture photograph. Failure to meet this standard at the end of
the second year of indoor work will necessitate enrollment in course 125 until the
standard is attained or until the end of the winter season of the senior year.
The 122 winter grade will be withheld until this requirement is fulfilled.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
lege course in one of the ancient or modern languages, and should
elect such courses in History and Art as deal in whole or in part with
Italian civilization and culture. Such courses will be required of
students working for honors.
Students taking a twenty-four-hour major should include 102, 201 or
202 or 207, 301, 305, 306, 307 or 308.
Students taking a thirty-hour major should include 102, 201, 202 or
207, 301, 305, 306, 307 or 308.
NOTE:—101 may not count toward the major.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination for students taking a major in Italian will
be based largely on the work done in the courses of grades II and III,
and will be of such a character as to bring out the interrelation of these
courses, bearing in mind that while some appear to be more closely
articulated than others, they all make their contribution to the cultural
development of Italian life. Some of the questions will have a direct
bearing on the content of the courses, while others will be of a more
general character, and will best be answered by opinions expressed
and deductions drawn.
The results of the elementary work will appear in the degree of ac-
curacy and ease of expression shown in the written portion of the
examination, but especially in translating from English into Italian
and vice versa.

GENERAL EXAMINATION
Modern Mathematics is a many sided subject, including fields widely
diverse in nature. Work in each of these fields, however, requires as a
basis an understanding of the fundamental principles and methods of
analytic geometry and the differential and integral calculus. This im-
plies skill in the use of elementary algebra, geometry, and trigonometry
as tools. Each student majoring in Mathematics is therefore expected
to spend two years in gaining acquaintance with the elements of these
essential subjects. On this foundation rests more advanced work of
three types: analysis, geometry, and applied mathematics. The work
offered by the department in these fields is as follows:
Analysis: 302, 303, 304, 308.
Geometry: 206, 208, 305, 309.
Applied Mathematics: 205, 206, 208, 303, Physics 305, Astronomy
302 or 303.
Course 203, History of Mathematics, is supplementary to all these
fields.
The general examination will include some questions on the funda-
mental subjects and some on the more advanced subjects, with special
emphasis on the interrelations between the courses.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
These courses are designed to provide for the general student a basis
for the interpretation of phenomena in the world of living things. At
the same time they may furnish a foundation for students who plan to
follow professionally some phase of biological work, such as teaching,
research, laboratory technique, medicine, public health, physical educa-
tion, nursing, medical social service.
Five-year Hygiene students wishing to major in the department
should elect 101 in the freshman or sophomore year, and 301, 313, and
302 in the junior and senior years.
Pre-medical students are referred to the requirements as given under
electives, page 37.
For public health work, students are advised to elect 101 or 203, 308
and 303. Students majoring in Zoölogy are advised to include Botany
308 among the courses related to the major.
A major is based on 101. A knowledge of Chemistry is required of
all students majoring in Physiology and is desirable for students major-
ing in Zoölogy. A reading knowledge of French and German is de-
sirable, though not required.
ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
165
Students majoring in Zoology or Physiology may under certain con-
ditions obtain permission from the Chemistry department to take
Chemistry 301 after having taken 101.
Students who intend to major in Zoology or Physiology as a founda-
tion for professional work are urged to consult with the department
before completing their plans.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination will test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles underlying animal life, the essential facts in-
volved, and their significance. It will also test her ability to correlate
the subject matter of the courses included in her major.
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
Wellesley is a residential college. The conditions of life at Wellesley
are designed to facilitate and supplement the scholar's activity.
The Deans are the officers most directly concerned with the organi-
zation of the academic community. In addition to the Dean of In-
struction, the Dean of Students, and the Dean of Residence, there is a
dean for each class. The Dean of Freshmen is ex officio chairman of the
Board of Admission and is, therefore, in a favored position to help en-
tering students take their places in the life of the College. At the be-
ginning of the sophomore year, each class is assigned to a member of the
teaching staff who is relieved from some duties in order to assume re-
sponsibility as the academic adviser for the class during its last three
undergraduate years. The Dean of Students is chairman of the class
deans and is especially responsible for the interpretation of educational
policy to the students. The Dean of Instruction is in charge of those
matters of educational policy and administration which relate es-
pecially to the faculty.
HALLS OF RESIDENCE are maintained for all undergraduates except
those within commuting distance who prefer to live at home. A Head
of House presides over each residence and coöperates with the student
ofi ers to develop the house group as a congenial social unit. Most
of the campus halls have resident faculty members, and other members
of the faculty are frequently entertained in the houses by students.
There are nine freshman houses. Seven of these are in the village, not
far from the campus, and accommodate approximately half the entering
class. Each freshman house has a freshman chairman with a junior as
her adviser. In each of the other campus houses, members of at least
three classes are in residence. Rooms are assigned to new students in
the order in which their original application fees have been received.
Students in residence at the time of the spring room-drawing choose
their rooms in the order of choice determined by lot within each class.
RELIGIOUS SERVICES are held daily in the College Chapel. On week
days these are conducted by some member of the faculty, except on
Thursday when a member of the senior class is the leader. The Sun-
day morning services are led by visiting clergymen of many denomina-
tions. In all these services the college choir, led by a member of the
department of Music, participates; and, in addition, there are a number
of special musical vesper services during the year. The Christian
Association conducts a varied program of religious discussions and
conferences, and its officers direct numerous service agencies in the
166
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
167
neighborhood of Wellesley in which many students participate. The
Christian Association coöperates with the Student Christian Movement
and is an important link between Wellesley students and those of other
colleges in this country and abroad.
THE HEALTH SERVICE is directed by the college physicians in coöp-
cration with the department of Hygiene and Physical Education. The
medical staff includes four physicians, one of whom is a psychiatrist.
One of the physicians is available for visits to student houses, and a
clinic is open without charge to all students at Simpson Infirmary,
where seven trained nurses are in constant attendance. The proximity
of the College to Boston permits frequent conference with other doctors,
and early consultation in case of serious illness is assured. Hospitals in
Boston and Newton are so accessible that immediate care can be given
to any type of illness or accident. In case of serious illness, parents are
notified by telephone or telegram. Seven days of infirmary care are
provided without charge to the student.
Emphasis is laid on preventive medicine and on the maintenance of
healthy living conditions on the campus. Campus employees are
examined by a college physician, and the doctors coöperate with the
dietitian and purveyor in the selection of food.
THE PLACEMENT OFFICE, established by the Founders of the College
as the Teachers' Registry, includes in its scope the placing of graduates
in teaching and in business positions, the supplying of information about
training courses, apprenticeships, and assistantships, the arranging of
lectures and discussions on occupations. Registration for placement is
open to all who have taken courses in Wellesley College. Students are
invited to register during their senior year but the office is open for con-
ference and advice to all students. The office maintains files, collects
credentials, and is the source of information concerning the vocational
equipment and experience of Wellesley women. The registration fee is
$2.00 for life membership, and no commission is charged for placement.
The office also registers undergraduates and alumnae for summer work,
and has charge of undergraduate employment.
The staff of the Placement Office consists of a Director, two Appoint-
ment Secretaries, a Consultant from the Psychology department, and
three assistants. This staff is in active coöperation with other ad-
ministrative offices.
THE COLLEGE GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION is responsible for the main-
tenance of efficient organization of the undergraduate community. It
is directed largely by students, though it receives its charter from the
Academic Council of the Faculty, which has representatives on its
governing boards. Other student organizations foster a variety of in-
168
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
terests: the Athletic Association; the Barnswallows (dramatic) Associa-
tion; the Christian Association; the Forum, which is a federation of such
organizations as the International Relations Club and the Domestic
Affairs Club; the Cosmopolitan Club; the Poetry Club; and numer-
ous departmental clubs. The Wellesley College Service Fund is admin-
istered by a special committee of faculty and students which raises and
distributes funds for educational and philanthropic agencies. The
largest item in its budget is the annual contribution to Yenching Uni-
versity in China.
There are six societies which combine informal social events with ex-
tra-curricular study. Each society has a small house containing club-
rooms and kitchen facilities. The membership in each group is limited
to thirty-five juniors and seniors, and the alumnae members maintain
an active interest.
EQUIPMENT
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
(Listed in order of construction)
COLLEGE HALL, the first academic building of Wellesley College, was
the gift of the founders, Mr. and Mrs Henry Fowle Durant. In 1875
it was finished and equipped under the close personal supervision of the
founders. On March 17, 1914, all but one wing of this historic building
was destroyed by fire. That wing, in constant use since 1914, was re-
modeled in 1936 and houses the department of Geology and Geogra-
phy. It is located on the hill overlooking Lake Waban.
Music Hall and BILLINGS Hall are large brick buildings devoted
to the department of Music. Music Hall, built in 1880, contains
offices, practice studios, and listening rooms, and includes in its equip-
ment thirty-seven pianos, six victrolas, a recording machine, and a two-
manual organ. The ground floor of Billings Hall (opened in 1904) is
given over to the department offices, two classrooms, and a small audi-
torium. These are equipped with six pianos, a clavichord, a three-
manual organ, two specially built phonographs of rare fidelity in
reproduction, and apparatus for the projection of music on a large il-
luminated screen. The second floor is occupied by the Music Library
and the office of the Research Librarian in Music.
The Music Library contains 4,350 scores, 2,400 reference books on
musical subjects, and 1,800 victrola records, and includes as well a
collection of musical manuscripts which is part of the Hazard Collec-
tion now housed in the treasure room of the main library.
The department has at its disposal the assignment to students of eight
tickets for the weekly concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
Symphony Hall, Boston.
SIMPSON INFIRMARY, a brick building erected in 1881, was used as a
residence hall until 1908. It now provides living quarters for the Resi-
dent Physician and the infirmary staff.
Adjoining this building is a thoroughly modern hospital unit com-
pleted in February, 1942. Besides the doctors' offices and well-
equipped clinic, there are twenty-three patients' bedrooms, lounges,
a solarium, and X-ray and physiotherapy laboratories.
THE FARNSWORTH ART BUILDING was the gift of the late Isaac D.
Farnsworth in 1889. It contains lecture rooms and exhibition galleries
and is used by the department of Art for its library, study rooms,
laboratories and studios.

A bulletin is published by the Museum at irregular intervals.
THE CHAPel was presented in 1899 by Miss Elizabeth G. Houghton
and Mr. Clement S. Houghton as a memorial to their father, Mr.
William S. Houghton, a trustee of the College from 1880 to his death in
1894. Its windows include memorials to the Founder of the College
and to various alumnae and members of the faculty. Behind the me-
morial tablet (by Daniel Chester French) in honor of Alice Freeman
Palmer are the urns holding her ashes and those of her husband, Pro-
fessor George Herbert Palmer, trustee of Wellesley College from 1912
to 1933. The three-manual, Aeolian-Skinner organ of ninety-one
stops was dedicated in the fall of 1936.
THE WHITIN OBSERVATORY is a one-story building of brick, faced
with white marble, situated on a small hill on the college grounds and
devoted entirely to the use of the department of Astronomy. THE OB-
SERVATORY HOUSE, the residence of the Director of the Observatory, is
nearby. The Observatory, the House, and much of the astronomical
equipment are gifts of the late Mrs. John C. Whitin.
MARY HEMENWAY Hall, on the western border of the campus, was
erected in 1909 as headquarters of the department of Hygiene and
Physical Education when the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics
became a part of Wellesley College.
THE LIBRARY of the College, endowed by Eben Norton Horsford, now
numbers over 212,400 bound volumes, including the departmental
libraries. The books in the General Library building form a collec-
tion chosen primarily for the use of students and instructors in the col-
lege courses in Literature and Languages, History, Economics, Sociol-
ogy, Philosophy, Education, Religious History, and certain of the sci-
ences. The General Library is open on weekdays from 8:10 A.M. to
9:30 P.M., and on Sundays from 2:30 to 9:30 P.M. Students have
EQUIPMENT
171
direct access to the shelves. The Library is catalogued by author and
subject entries, and the most recent and useful bibliographical aids are
provided. Special effort is made to train students in methods of
rescarch.
The Library subscribes for more than eight hundred American and
foreign periodicals, including daily newspapers representing different
sections of the United States, besides representative British and Con-
tinental dailies.
The Library has also many special collections of great interest and
value to the student doing graduate or other research work. Among
the most valuable of these are the Plimpton Collection, established by
Mr. George A. Plimpton in memory of his wife, Frances Pearsons
Plimpton, of the class of 1884, which comprises over a thousand vol-
umes of Italian books and manuscripts chiefly of the Renaissance; the
Ruskin Collection, the gift of Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed; and the Col-
lection of Early and Rare Editions of English Poetry given for the most
part by Professor George Herbert Palmer.
The Brooks Memorial Room, opened in 1921, provides comfortable
and beautiful surroundings with carefully selected books for leisure
hours of reading.
The following departmental libraries are located in the buildings of
the respective departments: Art, Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Geol-
ogy, Hygiene, Music, Physics, Psychology, and Zoology.
THE PAGE MEMORIAL SCHOOL on the college campus has two small
buildings and is devoted to the education of young children.
FOUNDERS Hall, a building for lecture rooms and department offices
pertaining to instruction in the liberal arts, was opened for use in 1919.
The hall was built from the Restoration Fund, secured for the College
through trustees, faculty, alumnae, and other friends, and replaces in
some part College Hall, the first and main building of the College. The
building is dedicated as a memorial to the Founders of the College,
Henry Fowle Durant and his wife, Pauline Adeline Durant.
ALUMNAE Hall, built in 1923 as the gift of the alumnae for a recrea-
tion center, contains an auditorium seating 1,570, a ballroom, a library,
committee rooms for the use of alumnae and students, and full equip-
ment for entertaining. There is also a recreation room, known as "The
Well”, which contains a soda fountain, tables for light refreshments,
and a nickelodeon.
SAGE HALL was built to house the departments of Botany and Zool-
ogy and Physiology. The first unit for the department of Botany was
erected in 1927, and the Zoology and Physiology unit in 1931. The
principal donor was Mrs. Russell Sage.
172
EQUIPMENT
HETTY H. R. GREEN HALL, the administration building, was in large
part the gift of Mrs. Green's son and daughter, Colonel Edward H. R.
Green and Mrs. Matthew A. Wilks. It contains the administrative
offices, class and seminar rooms, the faculty assembly hall, and offices of
student organizations. The Galen L. Stone Tower, named for its
donor, contains a carillon which was the gift of Mrs. Charlotte Nichols
Greene.
PENDLETON Hall was opened in 1935. It was named at the re-
quest of the undergraduates in honor of Ellen Fitz Pendleton, President
of the College from 1911 to 1936. This fire-proof building houses the
departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology.
THE RECREATION BUILDING, containing the GEORGE HOWE DAVEN-
PORT SWIMMING Pool, was opened in March, 1939. It is the gift of
many donors, two of whom, Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, gave large sums.
Students and alumnae gave generously to increase the "Swimming Pool
Fund” which accumulated for nearly thirty years. This building serves
as a recreation center for students, faculty, administration, alumnae,
and their guests.
LABORATORIES AND SCIENTIFIC COLLECTIONS
ASTRONOMY. The Whitin Observatory contains two rooms sur-
mounted by rotating domes, twenty-five feet and twelve and one-half
feet in diameter respectively; a transit room; a well-lighted room for
elementary laboratory work; and a room in which is kept the depart-
ment library. In the larger dome room is mounted a twelve-inch
Clark equatorial refracting telescope, which is provided with a filar
micrometer, a polarizing photometer, and an attachment for photo-
graphing the moon. The smaller dome contains a six-inch Clark
refractor, which is provided with an electric driving clock, a filar mi-
crometer, a wedge photometer, and an Evershed protuberance spectro-
scope, and which may be used as a guiding telescope for a small
photographic camera. Both domes are rotated by electric motors.
In the transit room is mounted a Bamberg prismatic transit of three
inches aperture. A four-inch telescope with objective by Browning is
mounted in a south wall of the building, with the eye end inside and the
optic axis parallel to the axis of the Earth; a plane mirror beneath the
object-glass reflects into the latter the light of the object observed. An
electrically driven heliostat, mounted in a separate small dome on the
roof, reflects sunlight through a lens of 18 feet focal length into the
basement, where, after an additional reflection, it is utilized in a
horizontally mounted Hale spectrohelioscope. The Observatory is
supplied with two Howard sidereal clocks, a Bond mean-time chronom-
eter, and a chronograph, any of which may be connected electrically
EQUIPMENT

through a switch-board with keys near the various telescopes; a
Berger surveyor's transit; a 60-mm. Zeiss tripod telescope; two calculat-
ing machines; a Gaertner comparator for measuring spectrograms; and
a large collection of illustrative apparatus, lantern slides, and photo-
graphs. A flat portion of the roof of the neighboring Sage Hall is fitted
with illuminated tables for the use of astronomy students during naked-
eye study of the sky.
Botany. The laboratories of the department of Botany in Sage
Hall are fully equipped for general and special work. Connecting with
the building at three points is a range of modern greenhouses consisting
of a large palm house and fourteen smaller houses. The greenhouses
contribute to all the courses in the department, but are of special
importance in connection with the work in general botany, plant cul-
ture, physiology, ecology, taxonomy, and genetics. Special labora-
tories, and constant-temperature dark-rooms and radiation-rooms, well
equipped with biological, chemical, and physical apparatus, are used
in conjunction with the greenhouses. The department has a wood-
working and machine shop for repairing and making apparatus. The
Susan M. Hallowell Memorial Library is exceptionally well supplied
with reference works and current periodicals. The illustrative collec-
tions comprise an herbarium of over 88,000 sheets, a working museum
of more than 5,000 specimens and models, and a large collection of
charts, lantern slides, and microscopical mounts. The department has
an “Outdoor Laboratory of small gardens for the use of students in
the beginning course, a Genetics field, and a Botanic Garden and Ar-
boretum. The native flora about Wellesley is easily accessible, fur-
nishing a convenient field for both the taxonomist and ecologist.
CHEMISTRY. The department of Chemistry has in Pendleton Hall
three lecture rooms with complete demonstration tables and apparatus
for special experiments, a seminar room, and a library in memory of
Professor Charlotte Fitch Roberts. Each course is provided with a
laboratory designed and equipped for its special needs. There is a
large dark room for optical instruments and smaller ones for photo-
graphic work. The laboratories are exceptionally well provided with
apparatus for advanced research in the field of spectrographic analysis,
of both the absorption and emission types. Rooms have been arranged
for special organic experiments, for electrolytic work and for micro-
combustions. General research rooms are available which are pro-
vided with equipment adaptable to various experimental problems.
Throughout the building there are systems for hot and cold water,
distilled water, gas, compressed air, vacuum, high-pressure steam,
hydrogen sulfide, and both direct and alternating current, so that these
services are available wherever desired.

EQUIPMENT
GEOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY. The building occupied by the depart-
ment of Geology and Geography contains well-equipped lecture rooms
and laboratories, a small library, and museum and case rooms for
housing the department's large collections of demonstration materials.
The museum and laboratory material of the department includes a
typical collection of dynamical and structural geology specimens,
systematic, mineralogical and petrographic collections, and a wide
variety of fossils. The department has two noteworthy collections.
The first is the Horace I. Johnson Mineral Collection, which consists of
five thousand valuable and beautiful mineral specimens, including
many precious metals and stones. This collection is the gift of the late
Mr. John Merton, and was presented through the Class of 1915 by the
courtesy of Miss M. Helen Merton. The second is the Reverend David
F. Pierce Collection, which includes a complete and rare collection of
building and ornamental stones and many precious and semi-precious
minerals. This collection is the gift of Professor Frederick E. Pierce of
Yale, Miss Anna H. Pierce, and Miss Mary E. Pierce of the Class of
1898.
The maps of the department include many large scale wall maps,
maps of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and complete
files of geologic folios and topographic maps of the United States
Geologic Survey. In addition several thousand topographic maps and
folios are arranged in collections for individual use in the laboratory.
The department has an excellent assortment of lantern slides which
illustrate many phases of geology and geography.
HYGIENE AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION. Mary Hemenway Hall provides
lecture rooms, completely equipped laboratories, photography and ex-
amining rooms, offices and conference rooms. The department library,
in charge of a full-time librarian, affords students unusual opportunities
to make use of the extensive collection of professional books, reference
works, periodicals, and pamphlets. A special endowment for this
library makes possible continual enrichment of the collection.
The Recreation Building, Mary Hemenway Hall, and adjacent ath-
letic fields include the following facilities, which serve as laboratories for
the professional students in Hygiene and Physical Education and for in-
structional classes and recreational activities for students, faculty, and
administration: a swimming pool, courts for badminton, basketball,
squash, tennis, and volley ball; an archery range; playing fields for
hockey, lacrosse, and softball; and activity rooms for fencing, gymnas-
tics, folk, modern and tap dance, individual corrective exercise and
modified recreational activities.
Lake Waban makes possible canoeing, crew rowing, skating, and
EQUIPMENT
175
swimming. Additional facilities include the green of the Outdoor
Theatre and the ballroom of Alumnac Hall for modern dance, a college-
owned golf course, and the bridle paths and riding ring of a nearby
riding club.
MATHEMATICS. The department has a collection of 250 models,
chiefly of thread, paper, plaster, or celluloid. The 50 Brill-Schilling
models include ruled surfaces, skew curves on celluloid, and three
kinematic models of cycloidal curves. There are several large thread
models used with the lantern in the study of skew curves, wire models for
Plateau's films, and many simple models, some of which were made by
members of the department and some by students. There is a fine
transit for the use of classes in trigonometry, a sextant, several types of
modern stereoscopes, a microfilm reader, and two computing machines
used in the classes in statistics.
Physics. The department of Physics has, on the second floor of
Pendleton Hall, large, well-lighted laboratories for general physics,
optics, electricity, and meteorology; on the first floor, lecture and reci-
tation rooms, with a central apparatus room, library, and offices. In
the basement are machine and wood shops, advanced laboratories,
research rooms, photographic dark rooms, glass-blowing and chemical
preparation rooms. Lecture tables and laboratories are fitted with gas,
water, compressed air and vacuum systems. Six electrical distribution
panels permit the use of direct and alternating currents of various
voltages in all parts of the building.
The equipment is thoroughly modern. The lecture apparatus is
sufficient to permit a wide range of experiments. Duplication of ap-
paratus permits close coördination between lectures and laboratory
work in the elementary courses. The department is especially well
equipped for advanced courses in the fields of optics, electricity, in-
cluding high frequency oscillations, electronics, and atomic physics.
PSYCHOLOGY. The laboratory in Pendleton Hall consists of a number
of small rooms in which an observer and subject may work on elemen-
tary problems; several larger laboratories for advanced problems re-
quiring more elaborate apparatus; specially designed rooms for studies
in visual, auditory, and olfactory sensations; facilities for photography;
a small but well-fitted workshop. There is also a room equipped for
animal experimentation. The money from the Sanford Fund is being
used to purchase all apparatus necessary for a modern laboratory.
The library and seminar room is dedicated to the memory of Eleanor
Acheson McCulloch Gamble, former professor of psychology.
ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The department of Zoology and Physi-
176
EQUIPMENT
ology occupies in Sage Hall lecture rooms, laboratories, research rooms,
a library-a memorial to Caroline B. Thompson-a museum, and a
vivarium which includes mammal rooms and runways and a large
aquarium room containing frog and turtle pools, tanks for salt and fresh
water forms and for tropical fishes.
The museum material includes teaching collections of fishes, amphibi-
ans, reptiles, birds and mammals, and many fine anatomical and embry-
ological models. Invertebrates are represented by extensive collec-
tions of insects and shells and models of important types.
RESIDENCES
The college residences are grouped into several units on and off the
campus. In all houses the rooms are provided with the necessary
furniture, including rugs and desk lamps.
The Hazard Quadrangle consists of four houses having approxi-
mately 88 students in each: Beebe, Cazenove, Pomeroy, and Shafer
Halls.
The Tower Court group receives its name from the largest of its three
buildings (which accommodates 216) and includes, also, Claflin Hall
(with 95 students) and Severance Hall (with 125).
Stone and Olive Davis Halls form one building, though each half is
operated as an independent unit for 80 students.
Norumbega Hall (with 54 students) is centrally located on the hill
with Green, Founders, and Pendleton Halls, and the Farnsworth Art
Building
Munger Hall was built in 1935 as a coöperative house to accommo-
date 114 students.
Dower House and Homestead are campus residences, each accom-
modating about 35 freshmen who take their meals at Olive Davis Hall.
Seven houses in the village-Crofton, Eliot, Elms, Washington,
Webb, Little, and Noanett-form a residence unit for approximately
200 freshmen.
Fiske House, the Graduate Club House, accommodating about 25,
is the social headquarters for all graduate students.
Horton, Shepard, and Hallowell Houses are club and apartment
houses for members of the faculty. They are located in close proximity
to the campus.
The President's House, Oakwoods (the home of the Dean of Stu-
dents), Crawford (the home of the Dean of Residence), and Observa-
tory House (the home of the Director of the Observatory), are on the
campus.
Each of the larger student residences contains several faculty apart-
ments.

SCHOLARSHIPS, LOANS, AND PRIZES
Scholarships maintained by income from permanent funds listed be-
low are awarded annually to undergraduate students, and grants are
made from other funds which the trustees set aside for this
purpose
each
year. The students who qualify for these scholarships are, in the main,
those who have been in Wellesley College at least a year, but some
freshmen and a few students who transfer from other institutions receive
grants. Awards are made in recognition of intellectual ability, of good
college citizenship and character, and of genuine financial need. The
magnitude of the scholarships ranges in general from $100 to $500.
Applications from students in college must be filed with the Dean of
Students, who is Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Scholarships,
on forms furnished for the purpose and in accordance with the instruc-
tions posted at the beginning of the second semester.
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR FRESHMEN:
A limited number of scholarships are offered to incoming freshmen.
Awards are based on financial need, scholastic ability, and promise of
good college citizenship. There are fifteen Pendleton Scholarships of
$600. As funds permit, sums ranging from $100 to $400 are awarded
to other freshman applicants.
Applications from all candidates for admission should be made to the
Dean of Freshmen before March 15 of the year of admission.
More detailed information about scholarships and coöperative houses
may be obtained by writing directly to the Dean of Freshmen.
COÖPERATIVE HOUSE:
Places in the coöperative house, Munger Hall, are awarded as schol-
arship grants to students qualified for receiving this aid and capable of
contributing to the work of the household.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT:
The Placement Office offers assistance to students who wish to earn
money toward their college expenses. The types of employment are
mainly clerical work, tutoring, library work, assisting in the various
offices of the College, and some domestic work. While the Placement
Office makes every effort to obtain places for those who wish to work,
it cautions students against depending upon this source for any regular
or considerable income. Such employment makes a distinct draft upon
strength and time, and it is hardly to be advised for the freshman year.
THE WELLESLEY STUDENTS' AID SOCIETY:
This organization is maintained by alumnae and former students of
the College, aided by the faculty and undergraduates, as their contribu-
180
SCHOLARSHIPS
181
tion towards keeping the opportunity of Wellesley open to students of
moderate means. Awards are made both in gifts and in loans, and
usually in some combination of the two. These awards are made on
practically the same basis as the college scholarships and supplement
them for necessary college expenses. They ordinarily range from $50
to $200. Loans and occasionally gifts in small sums, $5 to $25, are also
made for incidental expenses and emergencies.

sufficient work in Greek and Archæology to profit by the opportunity.
The object of the School is to furnish an opportunity to study in Greece
the literature, art, antiquities, and history of the country under suitable
guidance; to prosecute and to aid original research in these subjects;
and to assist in the exploration and excavation of classic sites. Three
fellowships of $1,200 each are awarded annually on the basis of com-
petitive examinations and are open to graduates of the coöperating
colleges of which Wellesley College is one. For further information

topography, palæography, and epigraphy, and of the art and archæol-
ogy of the early Christian, Mediæval, and Renaissance periods within
the boundaries of Italy. Those admitted are expected to put them-
selves under the guidance of the director of the Academy and the pro-
fessor in charge of the School for the full period of eight months. Duly
qualified graduates of Wellesley College are exempt from any charge
for tuition. Three fellowships in the school of Classical Studies are

HONOR SCHOLARSHIPS
Honor Scholarships (without stipend) have been established by the College
for the purpose of giving recognition to a high degree of excellence in academic
work. These honors fall into two classes: students in the first, or higher class,
are termed Durant Scholars; students in the second class are termed Wellesley
College Scholars.
These honors are awarded to seniors on the basis of two and one-half years'
work, to juniors on the basis of one and one-half years' work. The standard in
each case is absolute, not competitive.

HISTORICAL SKETCH
W
TELLESLEY COLLEGE is one of that group of women's colleges estab-
lished in the nineteenth century to offer to young women the edu-
cational opportunities “equivalent to those usually provided in colleges
for young men.” The motive of its founder, Henry Fowle Durant, was,
however, something more than the enrichment of the experience of
young women for their own sake. Addressing the first students in the
fall of 1875 he said, “You mistake altogether the significance of the
movement of which you are a part if you think this is simply a question
of a college education for girls. I believe that God's hand is in it; .
that He is calling to womanhood to come up higher, to prepare herself
for great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life, for noblest usefulness.”
To the end of preparing women for positions of responsibility, Mr.
Durant insisted from the beginning on the maintenance of high aca-
demic standards, and of healthy community life in beautiful surround-
ings. He built an impressive College Hall on his own spacious estate
fourteen miles west of Boston, and spared no pains to make his gift con-
tribute to the aesthetic development of students. He began to beautify
the four hundred acre campus which has become one of Wellesley's dis-
tinctive assets. He encouraged the inclusion in the student body of rep-
resentatives from all parts of the country and from foreign lands. He
placed more emphasis on personal quality than on the accident of eco-
nomic status, and he maintained a real democracy within the college
family. He opened unusual professional opportunities to women on
the faculty. He introduced laboratory work in science before it was
widely recognized as academically necessary. He recognized the sig-
nificance of the arts in education and encouraged "learning by doing."
He assumed that religion was a normal part of the life of educated peo-
ple and made provision for its study and expression in the program of
the new community.
From the beginning the Board of Trustees has been composed of men
and women whose interests have been far-reaching in New England and
around the world. The first board included the President of Yale Col-
lege, Chancellor of the University of the City of New York, Dean of the
Episcopal Theological School at Cambridge, President of Boston
University, a professor of the Rochester Theological Seminary and of
Andover Theological Seminary, two pastors, and a former Governor
of Massachusetts. The roster has been continuously noteworthy for the
calibre of the persons who have contributed of their time, their profes-
sional experience, their money to strengthen the College. The present
board includes educators as well as financiers, lawyers, an architect,
22
HISTORICAL SKETCH
23
a doctor, businessmen-men and women of wide cultural interests sc-
lected for their expert contribution. It is a working board. Three of
its regular members are nominated by vote of the Alumnae Association.
An unusual feature of organization is the membership of a “faculty
trustce” who is not a member of the faculty but is nominated by the Aca-
deinic Council.
The history of the College falls into two fairly distinct periods, before
and after the College Hall Fire. The College was chartered on March
17, 1870, but the planning of the program and the construction of Col-
lege Hall required five years of effort and the opening did not occur until
September, 1875. In a surprisingly short period, under the leadership
of President Ada Howard (1875-1881) and Alice Freeman (1881-1887),
the institution became established as a well-known college. It bor-
rowed ideas and methods from various institutions, notably Mount
Holyoke Seminary's program of domestic work for each student. It
drew heavily on the resources of Harvard University but at once as-
sumed responsibility for copying nothing blindly and for introducing a
type of instruction which gave scope to the initiative of students.
During the presidencies of Helen Shafer (1887-1894) and Julia Irvine
(1894–1899) the present curriculum of the College took shape and the
experimental venture in higher education for women became estab-
lished as a permanent part of the educational scene. President Caro-
line Hazard (1899-1910) brought to the academically mature College
the graciousness of the artist. Music, art, gracious living were re-
emphasized as important factors in a community of educated people.
On the night of March 17, 1914, College Hall burned to the ground.
The orderly evacuation of the building with no injury to any occupant
won world-wide fame for the already well-known College. In the
emergency created by this catastrophe President Ellen Fitz Pendleton
(1911-1936) came to the position of leadership which made her indeed
the builder which she will always be in the grateful memory of Welles-
ley women. Within twenty-five years the College grew from an in-
adequately housed, financially handicapped institution to a beautifully
equipped and well-endowed college. More significantly, Miss Pendle-
ton guided the reorganization of the faculty into a democratically con-
trolled policy-making body which worked consistently to maintain and
develop a vital curriculum and community life. She assisted in the for-
mation of a vigorous Alumnae Association and presided over the mag-
nificent efforts of the trustees and alumnae to raise enough money to
rebuild, expand, and endow the College.
During the very years of Wellesley's urgent need, the efforts of all
its members were directed to the war service of four overseas units.
Wellesley is no “ivory tower” to which people withdraw from contact
24
HISTORICAL SKETCH
with world needs. Her fourteen thousand alumnae, engaged in every
kind of responsible task, prove that fact. The register of graduates lists
Wellesley women living in each state of the United States and in fifty-
one foreign lands.
Wellesley College started with three hundred students, most of them
in a preparatory department which was part of the College until 1879.
It has become a college for fifteen hundred students, with fifty or sixty
graduate students. Commensurate with this growth, the external as-
pects of the College have changed almost completely. Starting with
one building, it now has forty-seven. It began with Mr. Durant's
private library of less than 10,000 volumes; its present library numbers
nearly 220,000 volumes. Its one gymnasium room has been replaced
by two large buildings to provide instructional and recreational facilities
for the graduate department of Hygiene and Physical Education and for
the enlarged undergraduate group.
With the coming of war in December, 1941, faculty and students alike
turned their attention toward preparing the College for its part in the
war effort. Changes were made in the lighting of buildings and grounds
to conform to the dimout regulations of this region, and a college organi-
zation for air-raid protection was developed in close coöperation with
the Town of Wellesley. The students modified their extracurricular
activities to free time for various kinds of community or war service.
Also, a faculty-student committee was organized to encourage students
to use vacations for this purpose. Students have met the shortage of
employees by doing domestic work in the houses coöperatively. On
October 1, 1943, the College received into Cazenove and Pomeroy
Halls a branch of the Navy Supply Corps School located at Harvard
University.
In the midst of these changes in the daily routine and in the external
aspects of college life, members of the faculty and administration are
making every effort to safeguard the integrity of the academic work
of the College and to play their part in maintaining the intellectual
disciplines underlying our civilization.
ADMISSION
YANDIDATES for the Bachelor of Arts degree may qualify for admission
to Wellesley College either as members of the freshman class, or as
students with advanced standing if they present acceptable records from
accredited colleges. Since the size of the student body is limited to
approximately fifteen hundred students, candidates in both groups are
chosen very carefully in order of the excellence of their credentials,
which include testimonials concerning health, character, and scholar-
ship.
APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION
All communications concerning admission should be addressed to the
Chairman of the Board of Admission, Wellesley College, Wellesley 81,
Massachusetts.
Forms of application will be furnished on request. An application
fee of ten dollars is required of all applicants and no registration is re-
corded until the fee is received. If the candidate cancels her registra-
tion or does not enter the College for any reason, the fee is not refunded,
but it may be transferred to apply to a later year if the request for the
transfer is received within a reasonable time after the beginning of the
year for which the candidate is registered to enter college.
A report from the applicant's physician showing that she is organically
sound and in good health, together with a certificate of vaccination and
any required tests, must be filed with the Board of Admission well in
advance of the date of entrance. The College reserves the right to re-
ject any candidate who, in the opinion of the college physicians, is not
fitted for work in the college community.
ADMISSION TO THE FRESHMAN CLASS
Application for admission to the freshman class may be made to the
Chairman of the Board of Admission at any time up to March 1 of the
year of entrance. A student is advised to make application at the be-
ginning of her secondary school course and she is urged to do so not
later than the fall of her junior year in secondary school so that her
school program may be approved before it is too late to make schedule
changes. Since rooms are assigned according to the date of application,
there is an added advantage in early registration. The date of applica-
tion is not considered, however, in the selection of candidates.
Through its admission procedure, the College tries to select students
with good intellectual ability, adequate preparation for further study,
genuine interest in the courses offered at Wellesley College, and a pur-
25
26
ADMISSION
pose which will give incentive to steady work. In making its selection
the Board of Admission reviews school records, recommendations, in-
formation from the candidate concerning her interests and plans of
study, and the results of the Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Tests.
Admission is on a selective and competitive basis, and from a large num-
ber of applicants the freshman class of about four hundred is chosen by
the Board. Candidates will receive notification of the results of their
applications late in May.
Students who are interested in admission should read carefully the
recommendations concerning secondary school subjects to be offered for
entrance and the statement concerning the required College Board tests.
ADMISSION SUBJECTS
For admission to Wellesley College 16 units * of secondary school
work are required. These units should be distributed mainly in the
fields of English, foreign language, mathematics, history, and science.
Candidates are advised to plan their programs early in their high
school course, taking into consideration the requirements for the B.A.
degree which are described on pages 33 to 35. The Board of Admission
will be glad to give advice or suggestions concerning the selection of
school courses. A student who is not certain that her entrance units
will be acceptable to Wellesley should write to the Board for information.
The courses listed below are recommended as providing a generally
satisfactory basis for work at Wellesley College:
English
units
Foreign Languages.
5 units
It is recommended that these 5 units be divided as follows: Latin
or Greek, 3 units; a modern language (French, German, Spanish,
or Italian), 2 units. Candidates from schools which recommend
other language programs are asked to write to the Board of Ad-
mission for approval of the distribution of their units. No credit
will be given for one unit of a foreign language.
Mathematics
3 units
These units are to consist of Algebra, 2 units, and Plane Geom-
etry, 1. The second unit of Algebra is completed in some schools
in a half year. When only two units of mathematics are offered
for entrance, one must be in Algebra, the other in Geometry.
History .
1 unit
This is the minimum requirement. The unit may be in any
branch of history. European History is especially recommended
for students interested primarily in languages, literature, and the
arts.
* A unit represents one year's study in any one subject, constituting approxi-
mately a quarter of a full year's work.
ADMISSION
27
1 unit
2 units
Science .
This unit may be in Biology, Physics, or Chemistry. General
Science may be counted as one of the free elective units.
Elective subjects
Additional units in any of the subjects listed above may be in-
cluded; or courses in Music (see below for specific requirement),
Art, Biblical History, and Social Studies, such as Problems of
Democracy, Economics, or general survey courses, may make up
the free units.
Candidates who wish to offer music for entrance after 1943 may
do so only when their courses have met the requirements laid
down by the Music Departments of Mount Holyoke, Smith, and
Wellesley Colleges. Music may be offered for one, two, or three
units as follows: one unit, fundamentals of music; two units, funda-
mentals of music and literature of music, or fundamentals and
practical music (literature of music and practical music may not
be offered except with fundamentals); three units, fundamentals
of music, literature of music, and practical music. A special
pamphlet including a detailed description of the music require-
ment is available.
Since Wellesley College is interested in having students from all parts
of this country and from foreign schools, the need for having a fairly
flexible program of entrance subjects is recognized. The Board of
Admission welcomes from school principals information about unusual
curricular plans or new courses which secondary schools recommend to
their students or about changes in the curriculum which have been in-
troduced recently. Unusual courses should have the approval of the
Board before they are submitted as a part of the student's entrance
program
The decision of the Board of Admission concerning a candidate will
in all cases depend on the general excellence of her school record and
recommendations and on her relative standing in the required entrance
tests.
SCHOOL RECORDS
Complete records of a student's work in secondary school are required.
Blanks for the preliminary records are sent to school principals in the
spring, a year in advance of the student's completion of preparatory
work. Blanks for supplementary records are sent during the year of
final preparation for college.
The school record must be supplemented by statements from the
school principal concerning the special abilities and interests of the
student, power of sustained work, good health habits, integrity, sense of
responsibility, initiative and self-reliance in work and in social action.
28
ADMISSION
The College wishes to be informed of circumstances which may have
furthered or interfered with a student's work and of special honors and
accomplishments during the student's secondary school course.
TESTS FOR ADMISSION
All candidates for entrance to the freshman class are required to take
the Scholastic Aptitude Test and three Achievement Tests given by
the College Entrance Examination Board. Application for these tests
must be made directly to the College Board in Princeton, New Jersey,
by the candidate herself. The dates for making application and the
address of the Board are given below.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test, which includes both verbal and mathe-
matical sections, is designed to test a student's general aptitude for col-
lege work. No special preparation for it is necessary. It is recom-
mended that this test be taken by a candidate in June of her junior
year in secondary school whenever this is possible.
Achievement Tests are given in English, Social Studies, four foreign
languages, and three sciences. (See page 29 for the complete list of
tests.) Candidates for admission to Wellesley are required to take the
English Test and two others chosen from different fields. These tests
should be taken in 1944 on April 15 so that the Wellesley Board of
Admission will have the results when it meets in May to select the
freshman class. The Scholastic Aptitude Test may also be taken at
this time if it has not been taken earlier.
Attention is called to the fact that the Achievement Tests are designed
to be taken in stride without extensive review or extra study and without
any speeding up of the school program. Students who have done good
work in a subject in school normally make good scores on the tests.
The results of the tests are evaluated according to the number of years
a candidate has spent studying a subject.
In addition to taking the Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Tests,
candidates from New York State may submit for admission their grades
on the Regents' examinations. Candidates from foreign countries are
expected to take the College Entrance Examination Board tests if it is
possible for them to make arrangements to do so.

ADMISSION TO ADVANCED STANDING
TERMS OF ADMISSION
If a student has maintained an excellent record in a recognized college
and has special interests which she can follow at Wellesley College,
she may apply for entrance with advanced standing credit. The
number of students admitted to advanced standing in any year, how-
ever, is limited and all entrance is on a competitive basis.
Applications for admission should be made before May 1 of the year
of entrance. Applicants are asked to read the section entitled "Appli-
ADMISSION
31
cation for Admission” on page 25. A candidate should show that
she has had the background of work recommended for admission to the
freshman class (see page 26) and has completed at least a full year of
highly satisfactory work at another college. She should be entitled to
honorable dismissal from the college which she has attended and
should be recommended by her instructors.
All candidates for admission to advanced standing are required to
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test of the College Entrance Examination
Board. Applicants who have taken this test should request the College
Board to send the results to Wellesley College. Those who have not
taken it should make arrangements to do so by writing directly to the
College Entrance Examination Board. Information concerning the
test is given on page 28, above.
A transfer student must spend at least two years at Wellesley College
to obtain the B.A. degree, one of which must be the senior year.
The
work of these two years must include all the prescribed work (see page
34) not covered by the credentials submitted and such courses as are
needed to meet the requirements for distribution and concentration
(see page 34). Credit will be tentatively granted early in the first
year of residence. The final determination of credit is not made until
the end of the first year since the success of advanced standing candidates
with work at Wellesley is an important consideration in deciding upon
credit.
The selection of applicants for admission with advanced standing
will be made in July of the year in which entrance is desired.
SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE
The following credentials must be submitted by candidates for ad-
vanced standing to the Board of Admission by July 1 of the year in
which entrance is desired:
1. Information blanks should be filled in and returned within two
weeks of the date on which they are received.
2. Health certificates, on the blank provided by the College, are due
not later than July 1.
3. Three photographs are also due by July 1. These should be of
standard passport size, glossy prints if possible.
4. A catalogue of the college attended with the candidate's name on
the cover should be sent at the same time that the information blanks
are sent. A list of the courses offered for credit with page references
to the catalogue should be given.
5. The candidate should request a letter of recommendation from one
of her instructors, to be sent to the office of the Board of Admission.
32
ADMISSION
6. The candidate should request that the official record of her rating
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test be sent to Wellesley College.
Other tests are not acceptable as substitutes for the Scholastic
Aptitude Test given by the College Entrance Examination Board.

college a transcript of the college record, a statement of graduation
from a junior college or of honorable dismissal from a four-year
college, and a recommendation from the college dean.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE M.A. AND M.S.
DEGREES
Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Educa-
tion, or Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education must be
graduates of Wellesley College or of other institutions of satisfactory
standing, and must present adequate credentials signifying their ability
to carry on the work for the degree.
Application for admission as a graduate student in any department
should be made upon forms which will be furnished by the Dean of
Graduate Students on request. It is desirable that the application be
sent by March first of the year in which the student proposes to enter.
It should be accompanied (1) by the official record of courses and
grades, (2) by a copy of the catalogue of the institution attended,
marked to indicate the courses taken.
Graduate scholarships are described on page 191.
For requirements for the M.A. and M.S. degrees see page 39. A cir-
cular containing full information for graduate students will be sent on
application to the Dean of Graduate Students.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE CERTIFICATE IN HYGIENE
AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION
A two years' course, especially designed for the training of teachers
of hygiene and physical education, and leading to the certificate of the
Department of Hygiene and Physical Education, is offered to gradu-
ates of approved colleges who meet the requirements. Full information
will be found on page 116.
Correspondence should be addressed to the Dean of Graduate
Students.
DEGREES
The following degrecs arc conferred by the Trustccs upon recom-
mendation of the Academic Council:
Bachelor of Arts.
Master of Arts.
Master of Arts in Education.
Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education.
Certificate in Hygiene and Physical Education.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.A. DEGREE
In constructing the curriculum of which the requirements are given below,
the faculty was guided by a belief that a student's four years in college should
give her several specific sorts of training. The prescribed work is planned to
assure her possession of certain skills which are of general use, and to add to
the information which she has acquired before coming to college further in-
formation considered of fundamental importance. Thus the prescribed work
in English Composition and Speech is designed to assure her having accuracy
and effectiveness in speaking and writing English. The prescription in Hy-
giene affords the student a knowledge of the laws of health. The prescribed
work in Biblical History gives a knowledge of the historical basis of Christianity.
The requirement of work for distribution is made with the purpose of securing
for each student some acquaintance with methods of work and ways of thinking
in various representative fields of knowledge. The requirement of work for con-
centration is made in order that the student shall make a reasonably thorough
study of one field of knowledge. The curriculum is so planned that a student
has the opportunity to elect without restriction a number of courses to suit her
individual need and interest.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must complete before graduation
the equivalent of one hundred and twenty semester hours, and have
in addition a reading knowledge of one of the following: French, Ger-
man, Greek, Italian, Latin, Spanish.
The examination to test the reading knowledge of one of these for-
eign languages will be given at the beginning of each semester. In
general the choice of the language to be offered is left to the student,
but any department offering work for a major may require its major
students to pass the examination in one particular language or in one
of any two or more specified languages. A student should therefore
consult the department in which she may wish to major before planning
to take her examination in a particular language. Students majoring
in a foreign language will be tested in a reading knowledge of a second
language; in this case students may postpone the examination until the
beginning of the senior year.

All courses are classified in grades I, II, III; grade I indicating cle-
mentary courses and grade III the most advanced courses. Of the
courses offered to fulfill the requirement of work for concentration at least
six hours of grade III must be taken in the senior year. Of the forty-
two hours required at least eighteen hours must be above grade I and
at least twelve hours must be of grade III.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must pass a general examination in a
major subject in addition to the regular course examinations.
COURSE EXAMINATIONS
An examination period occurs at the end of each semester. Exami-
nations for the removal of conditions and deficiencies and for advanced
standing may be taken during any examination period and at other
specified times.
A student who wishes to take an examination upon a course which is
not a part of her approved schedule for the year, must apply to the
College Recorder for the requisite card of admission to the examination.
STANDARD FOR GRADUATION
A certain quality grade is required for graduation and, for the pur-
pose of determining this quality grade, numerical values called “points”
are given to the grade letters as follows: for grade A, three points for
each semester hour of the course in which the grade is received; for
grade B, two points; for grade C, one point; for grade D (passing), no
points; for a grade below D, no points and not counted in hours toward
a degree. In order to be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of
Arts a student must in each semester attain as many quality points as
the hours she carries, i.e., a credit ratio of 1.0. (The credit ratio is the
ratio of the number of quality points earned to the semester hours
carried.) Deficiency of points in any semester may be made good only
in accordance with regulations adopted by the faculty. In general,
students who are deficient in quality points at the end of the third year
or who are otherwise not of diploma-grade standing will not be per-
mitted to continue.
The College reserves the right to require the withdrawal of students
whose academic standing is not satisfactory, and of those who for any
other reason have shown themselves to be not in accord with the ideals
and standards which the College seeks to maintain.
HONORS IN A SPECIAL FIELD
Recognition of the desire of certain students to carry on consecutive
and somewhat intensive work along the line of their particular interests
has led to the introduction of a plan for Honors in a Special Field.
36
DEGREES
A student electing to study for Honors will choose a Field of Special
Study and will work in that field under the direction of one or more of
the instructors concerned who will advise her on the possible develop-
ment of her field and will guide her in the carrying on of independent
work within it.
Students who wish to become candidates for Honors may apply in
the spring of their sophomore or junior year to the committee appointed
to consider these applications.
DEPARTMENTAL HONORS
A plan for Departmental Honors has been established to enable cer-
tain students to enrich the work of the major subject by engaging in a
program of supplementary directed work in the senior year. A can-
didate for Departmental Honors will carry a normal senior program
supplemented by work in the major subject done under the special di-
rection of one or more instructors. The supplementary work will be
planned to suit the needs and interests of the individual student.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELECTING COURSES
The program in the freshman year is as follows:
English Composition 101.
6 hours
Hygiene 120
2 hours
Hygiene 121 (practical work 2 hours)
1 hour
Electives, 4 six-hour courses
24 hours
Total.
33 hours
The courses must be chosen in accordance with the prerequisites
given in the department statements from the list of courses named be-
low, with the provision that one course must be chosen from each of two
of the three groups described below. It is unwise to include two begin-
ning courses in modern language.
ELECTIVE COURSES OPEN TO FRESHMEN, ARRANGED BY GROUPS
Group I. Art 101, 102, 103, English Literature 101, 103, French 101,

the normal program for the remaining years would be as follows:
Sophomore year.

C
If thirty-three hours are not completed in both the freshman and
sophomore years, it will be necessary for a student to attend summer
school or to carry more hours in the junior and senior years than speci-
fied above, subject to certain regulations.
Elective courses must be chosen with great care so that changes will
not be necessary. Students are held responsible for observing the
requirements for the degree and the proper sequence of courses.
PREPARATION FOR WAR SERVICE
In the present crisis each student will wish to prepare for usefulness
in the war effort and at the same time to educate herself to bear a re-
sponsible part in furthering the best in our national life both now and
after the war. These aims need not be in conflict if programs of study
are planned intelligently. Each student should choose the major sub-
ject best suited to her abilities and interests since by so doing she will
achieve her best intellectual development. Study in certain fields,
notably the sciences, the social sciences, and the modern languages,
may prepare for essential war work in industry or government, or for
service in the period of reconstruction. The student whose major study
is not directed to these ends may in her free electives or in extracurricu-
lar courses prepare for useful work upon graduation. The attention
of all students is called to the critical shortage of teachers. Graduates
of the liberal arts colleges are especially well qualified to meet the nced
for this important work.
For all students it is especially necessary to plan a carefully co-
ordinated program since certain combinations of courses lead directly
to important work requiring college preparation. The class deans,
members of the faculty, and the secretaries of the Placement Office
will gladly give information and assistance to students in making
their plans.
Provision is made for individual students to complete the work for
the degree in three or three and one-half years by carrying extra hours
and by attending summer sessions at colleges of recognized standing.
Students who expect to become doctors or nurses and those with
38
DEGREES
special aptitudes for work in mathematics or in certain of the physical
and social sciences, fields in which trained workers are urgently needed,
should seriously consider accelerating the college course.
The curriculum, described in this bulletin, will be supplemented by
extracurricular courses sponsored by the Committee on War Activities
and directed toward the war effort. The extracurricular program
will include the following courses: Biological Laboratory Techniques,
Canteen and Nutrition, Drafting (elementary and advanced), First
Aid, Home Maintenance, Home Nursing, Nurse's Aide, special Lan-
guage courses in French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Russian, Prin-
ciples of Accounting, Report Writing, Typewriting and Shorthand.
PRE-PROFESSIONAL COURSES
Students who plan to apply for admission to professional schools after
leaving Wellesley College should consult their class deans about appro-
priate electives early in the course.
Each student who is planning to study medicine is advised to confer
with her class dean before the beginning of her sophomore year.
Enter-
ing students are advised to elect two pre-medical sciences in the fresh-
man year. In general, requirements for admission to medical schools
of Class A can be met by eighteen hours in Chemistry and twelve hours
in Physics and Zoölogy respectively, but each student is advised to study
carefully the requirements for the particular school which she has
chosen. Attention is called to the fact that twenty-four hours are re-
quired as a basis for the general examination in any department. It is,
however, possible to fulfill the minimum requirement for medical
schools, and to take the general examination in an entirely different
field.
Students planning to prepare for work in hospital or public health
laboratories should begin both Chemistry and Zoology in their freshman
year in order to have the necessary foundation for advanced courses.
The departments of Botany, Chemistry, Physics, and Zoology should
be consulted concerning combinations of courses in later years of the
college course.
PREPARATION FOR TEACHING
A student wishing special preparation for teaching may plan a five
year integrated course leading to a Bachelor of Arts at the end of the
fourth year and a Master of Arts in Education at the end of the fifth.
The courses in a student's field of concentration and her free electives
will be chosen to provide preparation in the subjects which she espe-
cially desires to teach. Her program will include also courses in Edu-
cation which will enable her to meet requirements for certification in
DEGREES
39
many states. Practice teaching will be included in the work of the
fifth year.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.A. AND M.S. DEGREES
Wellesley College offers graduate work leading to the degrees of
Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Science in
Hygiene and Physical Education. The work required of a candidate is
considered to be the equivalent of twenty-four hours of college work.
In general, a candidate is required to work in one department. The
program includes no fewer than two full courses of Grade III or their
equivalent, and may include a thesis embodying the results of original
research or reports based on independent work. A candidate for a
Master's degree is required to have a working knowledge of either
French or German, to be tested by examination at entrance. Individual
departments may require a second language. At least one year of
graduate study is required of all candidates, but more time may be
needed for the completion of the work. One year in residence is re-
quired of all candidates except graduates of Wellesley College who have
done the work at some institution which does not grant a Master's de-
gree to women.
Information regarding requirements for admission, theses, final ex-
aminations, etc., will be found in the Graduate Circular which will be
sent on application to the Dean of Graduate Students.

HISTORY OF ART
Many of the courses in Art include some laboratory work in the one or more
mediums with which the course is concerned. The department believes that
laboratory training has great value in developing observation and understand-
ing of problems of art, and for this reason requires it of majoring students. It
should be stated, however, that no particular natural aptitude is required and
that the work is scaled to the student's ability.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
The courses in Botany are intended to present to the general student
a basis for understanding and interpreting the phenomena of the world
of living things and, at the same time, to furnish a foundation for stu-
dents who plan to follow professionally some phase of biological work.
The major in Botany is based on 101 or on two of the following:
202, 203, 204, 206. The grade III courses, while still emphasizing
fundamental biological principles, give more specific training in differ-
ent phases of botanical science. A variety of sequences of courses
is available. Any member of the department will be glad to talk with
students concerning the department courses and supplementing courses
that will most nearly fill their needs. Those students who are planning
to continue their botanical work after graduation along lines of teaching,
research, agricultural and experiment station work, in various kinds of
technical laboratory work, landscape gardening, horticulture, or mu-
seum work, etc., will find it advisable to discuss their plans with the
department as early as possible in their course.

courses, such as 304, 306, and 307, in this department, as well as courses
in Chemistry and Zoology, supplement these offerings.
Course 350 is open for independent study or advanced work in any
field in which the student has had a grade III course in the department.
Courses 308 and 312 may form a part of a Botany major that includes
a year of grade III other than, or in addition to, 309-310 or 350.
The department offerings in Landscape Design, 309–310, may form
a part of a Botany major that includes a year of grade III other than, or
in addition to, 308 or 312.
Botany majors may, under certain conditions, obtain permission from
the Chemistry department to take Chemistry 301 after having had
Chemistry 101.
The department will accept a reading knowledge of any of the foreign
languages prescribed by the College to fulfill its requirements, but of
these it considers French, German, or Latin to be of special value.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination aims to test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles and the basic facts of plant science and to de-
termine her ability to correlate and utilize this information.
A sufficient number of questions will be given to provide a choice for

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
Members of the department will be glad to advise students concerning
courses (in Chemistry and in related departments) which would best
prepare for teaching, for positions in analytical and research and in-
dustrial laboratories, for work as hospital laboratory technicians,
for public health work, for nursing, or for graduate study.
For any major in Chemistry one of the following sequences of courses
is essential: 101, 201, 202, and 301; or 103, 202, and 301. Any other
courses in the department may be added to these to complete the
twenty-four-hour major.
It is advisable that all students majoring in Chemistry should com-
plete one year of college physics and one year of college inathematics,
and acquire a reading knowledge of French and German before the
senior year. They will be required to pass a reading knowledge exami-
nation in German, or French.
Pre-medical students are referred to the requirements as given on
page 38.
For hospital and public health work, students are advised to elect
101 and 201, or 103, 202, 301, 304 and 309.
Seniors electing Chemistry 304 and 309 may, upon the recommenda-
tion of this department, obtain special permission from the Zoology
department to take Physiology (Zoology 308) without prerequisite.
Students intending to use their chemistry after graduation will be
recommended by the department only if they have completed at least
eighteen hours of chemistry.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The aim of the general examination in chemistry will be to test the
student's knowledge of the fundamental principles and important
facts of chemistry, and her ability to correlate and apply this material.
CLASSICAL ARCHÆOLOGY
The departments of Art, Greek, and Latin offer a program of study
constituting a major in Archäology. The purpose of this major is to
correlate the courses in ancient art with those in Greek and Latin lan-
guage and literature, in order to provide opportunity for a more com-
prehensive study and understanding of ancient civilization than is
available within any one of the separate departments. This major will
ECONOMICS
65
also serve as a basic preparation for those students contemplating
graduate and field work in archæology.
The work for concentration should normally include forty-eight hours
divided as follows: eighteen hours in Art; either eighteen hours in Greek
and six hours in Latin or eighteen hours in Latin and six in Greek; six
hours in Ancient History (203 or 204). From the courses elected in
Art, Greek, and Latin, thirty hours will be chosen to form the major.
The choice will be made by the student in consultation with the chair-
man in charge of the work in archæology.
All courses in the Greek and Latin departments may be counted in
the field for concentration, except Greek 203, 204, 207, and Latin 104,
105. In the Art department the following courses may be counted:
101, 209, 314, 318, 320. In addition to these, 350 work may be taken
in any one of the three departments concerned. The complete pro-
gram should include six hours of grade III work in Art and six hours of
grade III work in either Greek or Latin.
Some knowledge of geology is useful for field archæology; chemistry
is valuable both for field and museum work.
A reading knowledge of French, German, or Italian is required for
this major.
The work of the Archæology major will be supervised by a joint
committee composed of representatives from the three departments
concerned. Students should have their program approved by the
chairman of this committee who will be Associate Professor Dorothy M.
Robathan for the year 1943–44.
The general examination will cover the thirty hours of work included
in the major. It will be given in two parts, one on art, the other on
language and literature.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
1. MAJOR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
Distribution of work: Course 101, six hours of grade II work, and two
courses of grade III, form the usual sequence for the minimum English
Literature major. It is possible to begin a major in the junior year
by entering a grade II course. Concentration on any one period or
type is not advised for majors. Proper distribution should be insured
by conference with the 101 instructor, and with the chairman of the
department in the spring of the sophomore year.
The following courses in English Literature are not counted in the
major: 104, 210, 212, 213.
Related courses: Related courses for concentration may be chosen from
many fields. Knowledge of at least one foreign literature, and ability
to read certain foreign languages, ancient and modern, is of great value
to the student of English Literature. Understanding of the history of
the periods in which the literature is studied is also important. In
English Composition special attention is called to 201, 208, 303; in the
classical departments, to Greek 203, 204, and Latin 105, dealing with
Greek and Latin literature in translation; in Italian, to 103, Introduc-
tion to the Study of the Italian Renaissance. The attention of students
who are interested in the teaching of English is called to Education 307,
The Teaching of English in the Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
The examination will consist of questions covering the courses in-
cluded in the English Literature major. In this list there will be a
sufficient number of questions to insure a fair opportunity for choice.
Each student will select the questions dealing with the subjects she has
studied in her own major. The questions will seek to test: (1) The
ENGLISH
85
student's knowledge of authors, works, types in the periods included in
her major; (2) her intelligence and accuracy in correlating her knowl-
edge; (3) her independence of judgment and her literary discrimination.
II. MAJOR IN ENGLISII COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: English Coinposition 101, required of all stu-
dents, will not be counted as part of the major in Composition. For
a twenty-four-hour major the following combination is recommended:
two or more semester courses of grade II (sec restrictions under indi-
vidual courses); twelve hours of grade III, in which 303 must be in-
cluded. At least six hours above grade I of English Literature must
be included.
Note: No two writing courses may be taken at the same time, but
English Composition 303 and courses in English Literature may be
taken simultaneously with a writing course. Courses 209 and 312 in
English Literature are counted as courses in Composition, and may be
included in a twenty-four-hour major in English Composition together
with six hours of English Literature above grade I. Work in Compo-
sition for the senior year of such a major must be of grade III: 304 or 350
(year); or some combination of 300, 301, 302, 305, 350 (semester).
Related courses: Students intending to teach or to engage in literary
work should include in their program additional courses in English
Literature. Some knowledge of Latin and Greek literature in the
original or in translation is highly important for a teacher of English,
as is a background of history, especially English history. The attention
of students who are interested in the teaching of English is called to
Education 307, The Teaching of English in the Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
The general examination in English Composition will include ques-
tions on the theory“on the principles of craftsmanship-underlying
the specific courses the student has taken; it will include a study of the
forms of description, narration, and exposition in their gencral aspects;
a study of differing types of essay, of biography, of criticism; a study of
the historical development of the sentence, of the paragraph, and of the
linguistic elements composing our vocabulary. The student will be
expected to organize her answers clearly and to write with reasonable
fluency and finish. Supplementary reading and detailed instructions
will be given in a department statement to majors.
III. JOINT MAJOR IN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: This major consists of twelve hours of English
Composition beyond Composition 101, and eighteen hours of English
86
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
Literature. A student may elect further work in either Literature or
Composition, or both, or in some related subject, as part of the forty-
two hours in her field of concentration.
The courses in Composition should include six hours of grade II
and six hours of grade III. Students exempted from Composition
101 at midyears should complete the year with a Composition course of
grade II.
The courses in Literature should include at least six hours of grade
II and six hours of grade III. One of the following courses not counted
in the Literature major-210, 212—may count as part of the joint
major. In general, one of the Literature courses elected should deal
with a period earlier than the nineteenth century.
Related courses: The background of related courses to be desired for
this major is the same as that described under the majors in Literature
and Composition.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
This joint examination will consist of a combination of questions
selected from the general examinations set for English Literature and
English Composition. The questions will deal with the material in
both fields included in the student's program for the joint major.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
GEOGRAPHY. Students who wish to major in geography will find that
this work correlates well with work in history and economics. For ad-
vanced work in the subject, both French and German are useful, though
there is somewhat more material available in French than in German.
A geography major should include the first semester of 101, 102,
208, 209, and at least twelve hours of grade III work in geography.
(For students who took 101 in 1940-41 or earlier, and for those who
took 208 and 209 in 1941-42 or earlier, the second semester of 101 may
be substituted for 102 in the major.)
By permission, six hours of closely correlated work in history will be
accepted as part of a major in geography.
The attention of students who are interested in the teaching of geog-
raphy is called to Education 308, The Teaching of Social Studies in the
Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
A major offered for the general examination in geology must include
101; that for the general examination in geography must include the
first semester of 101 and 102. (An exception is made for certain stu-
dents. See “Directions for Election” on preceding page.)
With the possible exception of questions based upon the first semester
of 101, entirely different examinations will be set for the students major-
ing in geology and those majoring in geography. Some choice of
questions will be possible. The questions will test ability to correlate
the subject matter of the various courses covered and to apply the prin-
ciples made familiar through these courses in the interpretation of new
situations and the solution of new problems.
The department will suggest supplementary summer reading for
those students who desire such assistance.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
A major in Italian is generally based on 101. It is very desirable
that students majoring in Italian should have had or be taking a col-
lege course in one of the ancient or modern languages, and should
elect such courses in history and art as deal in whole or in part with
Italian civilization and culture. Such courses will be required of
students working for honors.
Students taking a twenty-four-hour major should include 102, 201 or
202 or 207, 301, 304, 306, 307 or 308.
Students taking a thirty-hour major should include 102, 201, 202 or
207, 301, 304, 306, 307 or 308.
Note:---101 may not count toward the major.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination for students taking a major in Italian will
be based largely on the work done in the courses of grades II and III,
and will be of such a character as to bring out the interrelation of these
courses, bearing in mind that while some appear to be more closely
articulated than others, they all make their contribution to the cultural
development of Italian life. Some of the questions will have a direct
bearing on the content of the courses, while others will be of a more
general character, and will best be answered by opinions expressed
and deductions drawn.
The results of the elementary work will appear in the degree of ac-
curacy and ease of expression shown in the written portion of the
examination, but especially in translating from English into Italian
and vice versa.
* It will be the privilege of students in grade III courses to have access to the
manuscripts and early—often contemporary-editions of Italian authors contained
in the French Pearsons Plimpton Collection.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
A major must include at least twelve hours of grade III.
The ability to read French, German, or Italian is required in all grade
III courses. A reading knowledge of more than one of these languages
is desirable.
Only those students who have completed satisfactorily at least six
hours of grade III in the department will be recommended as teachers
of mathematics.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
Modern mathematics is a many sided subject, including fields widely
diverse in nature. Work in each of these fields, however, requires as a
basis an understanding of the fundamental principles and methods of
analytic geometry and the differential and integral calculus. This im-
plies skill in the use of elementary algebra, geometry, and trigonometry
as tools. Each student majoring in mathematics is therefore expected
to spend two years in gaining acquaintance with the elements of these
Music
133
essential subjects. On this foundation rests more advanced work of
three types: analysis, geometry, and applied mathematics. The work
offered by the department in these fields is as follows:
Analysis: 302, 303, 304, 308.
Geometry: 206, 208, 305, 309.
Applied Mathematics: 205, 206, 208, 303, Physics 305, Astronomy
302 or 303.
Course 203, History of Mathematics, is supplementary to all these
fields.
The general examination will include some questions on the funda-
mental subjects and some on the more advanced subjects, with special
emphasis on the interrelations between the courses.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
These courses are designed to provide for the general student a basis
for the interpretation of phenomena in the world of living things. At
the same time they may furnish a foundation for students who plan to
follow professionally some phase of biological work, such as teaching,
research, laboratory technique, medicine, public health, physical educa-
tion, nursing, medical social service.
Five-year Hygiene students wishing to major in the department
should elect 101 in the freshman or sophomore year, and 301, 313, and
302 in the junior and senior years.
Pre-medical students are referred to the requirements as given on
page 38.
For public health work, students are advised to elect 101 or 203, 308
and 303 in this department and to include Botany 308 among the
courses related to the major.
A knowledge of Chemistry is required of all students taking work
in Physiology and is desirable for all students majoring in the depart-
ment. A reading knowledge of French and German is desirable,
though not required.
Students majoring in the department may under certain conditions
obtain permission from the Chemistry department to take Chemistry
301 after having taken 101.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination will test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles underlying animal life, the essential facts in-
volved, and their significance. It will also test her ability to correlate
the subject matter of the courses included in her major.
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
Wellesley is a residential college. The conditions of life at Wellesley
are designed to facilitate and supplement the scholar's activity.
THE Deans are the officers most directly concerned with the organi-
zation of the academic community. In addition to the Dean of In-
struction, the Dean of Students, and the Dean of Residence, there is a
dean for each class. The Dean of Freshmen is ex officio chairman of the
Board of Admission and is, therefore, in a favored position to help en-
tering students take their places in the life of the College. At the be-
ginning of the sophomore year, each class is assigned to a member of the
teaching staff who is relieved from some duties in order to assume re-
sponsibility as the academic adviser for the class during its last three
undergraduate years. The Dean of Students is chairman of the class
deans and is especially responsible for the interpretation of educational
policy to the students. The Dean of Instruction is in charge of those
matters of educational policy and administration which relate es-
pecially to the faculty.
HALLS OF RESIDENCE are maintained for all undergraduates except
those within commuting distance who prefer to live at home. A Head
of House presides over each residence and coöperates with the student
officers to develop the house group as a congenial social unit. Most
of the campus halls have resident faculty members, and other members
of the faculty are frequently entertained in the houses by students.
There are nine freshman houses. Seven of these are in the village, not
far from the campus, and accommodate approximately half the entering
class. Each freshman house has a freshman chairman with a junior as
her adviser. In each of the other campus houses, members of at least
three classes are in residence. Rooms are assigned to new students in
the order in which their original application fees have been received.
Students in residence at the time of the spring room-drawing choose
their rooms in the order of choice determined by lot within each class.
RELIGIOUS SERVICES are held daily in the College Chapel. On week
days these are conducted by some member of the faculty, except on
Thursday when a member of the senior class is the leader. The Sun-
day morning services are led by visiting clergymen of many denomina-
tions. In all these services the college choir, led by a member of the
department of Music, participates; and, in addition, there are a number
of special musical vesper services during the year. The Christian
Association conducts a varied program of religious discussions and
conferences, and its officers direct numerous service agencies in the
168
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
169
neighborhood of Wellesley in which many students participate. The
Christian Association coöperates with the student Christian Movement
and is an important link between Wellesley students and those of other
colleges in this country and abroad.
THE HEALTH SERVICE is directed by the college physicians in coöp-
eration with the department of Hygiene and Physical Education. The
medical staff includes four physicians, one of whom is a psychiatrist.
One of the physicians is available for visits to student houses, and a
clinic is open without charge to all students at Simpson Infirmary,
where seven trained nurses are in constant attendance. The proximity
of the College to Boston perinits frequent conference with other doctors,
and early consultation in case of serious illness is assured. Hospitals in
Boston and Newton are so accessible that immediate care can be given
to any type of illness or accident. In case of serious illness, parents are
notified by telephone or telegram. Seven days of infirmary care are
provided without charge to the student.
Emphasis is laid on preventive medicine and on the maintenance of
healthy living conditions on the campus. Campus employees are
examined by a college physician, and the doctors coöperate with the
dietitian and purveyor in the selection of food.
THE PLACEMENT OFFICE, established by the Founders of the College
as the Teachers' Registry, includes in its scope the placing of graduates
in teaching and other professions, government, and industry; the sup-
plying of information about training courses, apprenticeships, and as-
sistantships; and the arranging of lectures and discussions on occupa-
tions. Registration for placement is open to all who have taken courses
in Wellesley College Students are invited to register during their
senior year but the office is open for conference and advice to all stu-
dents. The office maintains files, collects credentials, and is the source
of information concerning the vocational equipment and experience of
Wellesley women. The registration fee is two dollars for life member-
ship, and no commission is charged for placement. The office also
registers undergraduates and alumnae for summer work, and has charge
of undergraduate employment.
The staff of the Placement Office consists of a Director, two Appoint-
ment Secretaries, a Consultant from the Psychology department, and
three assistants. This staff is in active coöperation with other ad-
ministrative offices,
THE COLLEGE GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION is responsible for the main-
tenance of efficient organization of the undergraduate community. It
is directed largely by students, though it receives its charter from the
Academic Council of the Faculty, which has representatives on its
170
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
governing boards. Other student organizations foster a variety of in-
terests: the Athletic Association; the Barnswallows (dramatic) Associa-
tion; the Christian Association; the Forum; the Cosmopolitan Club; the
Poetry Club; and numerous departmental clubs. The Wellesley
College Service Fund is administered by a special committee of faculty
and students which raises and distributes funds for educational and
philanthropic agencies. The largest item in its budget is the annual
contribution to Yenching University in China.
There are six societies which combine informal social events with ex-
tra-curricular study. Each society has a small house containing club-
rooms and kitchen facilities. The membership in each group is limited
to thirty-five juniors and seniors, and the alumnae members maintain
an active interest.
EQUIPMENT
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
(Listed in order of construction)
COLLEGE Hall, the first academic building of Wellesley College, was
the gift of the founders, Mr. and Mrs Henry Fowle Durant. In 1875
it was finished and equipped under the close personal supervision of the
founders. On March 17, 1914, all but one wing of this historic building
was destroyed by fire. That wing, in constant use since 1914, was re-
modeled in 1936 and houses the department of Geology and Geogra-
phy. It is located on the hill overlooking Lake Waban.
Music Hall and Billings Hall are large brick buildings devoted
to the department of Music Music Hall, built in 1880, contains
offices, practice studios, and listening rooms, and includes in its equip-
ment thirty-seven pianos, six victrolas, a recording machine, and a two-
manual organ. The ground floor of Billings Hall (opened in 1904) is
given over to the department offices, two classrooms, and a small audi-
torium. These are equipped with six pianos, a clavichord, a three-
manual organ, two specially built phonographs of rare fidelity in
reproduction, and apparatus for the projection of music on a large il-
luminated screen. The second floor is occupied by the Music Library
and the office of the Research Librarian in Music.
The Music Library contains 4,500 scores, 2,500 reference books on
musical subjects, and 2,400 victrola records, and includes as well a
collection of musical manuscripts which is part of the Hazard Collec-
tion now housed in the treasure room of the main library.
The department has at its disposal the assignment to students of eight
tickets for the weekly concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
Symphony Hall, Boston.
SIMPSON INFIRMARY, a brick building erected in 1881, was used as a
residence hall until 1908. It now provides living quarters for the Resi-
dent Physician and the infirmary staff.
Adjoining this building is a thoroughly modern hospital unit com-
pleted in February, 1942. Besides the doctors' offices and well-
equipped clinic, there are twenty-three patients' bedrooms, lounges,
a solarium, and X-ray and physiotherapy laboratories.
THE FARNSWORTH ART BUILDING was the gift of the late Isaac D.
Farnsworth in 1889. It contains lecture rooms and exhibition galleries
and is used by the department of Art for its library, study rooms,
laboratories and studios.

THE CHAPEL was presented in 1899 by Miss Elizabeth G. Houghton
and Mr. Clement S. Houghton as a memorial to their father, Mr.
William S. Houghton, a trustee of the College from 1880 to his death in
1894. Its windows include memorials to the Founder of the College
and to various alumnae and members of the faculty. Behind the me-
morial tablet (by Daniel Chester French) in honor of Alice Freeman
Palmer are the urns holding her ashes and those of her husband, Pro-
fessor George Herbert Palmer, trustee of Wellesley College from 1912
to 1933. The three-manual, Aeolian-Skinner organ of ninety-one
stops was dedicated in the fall of 1936.
The Whitin OBSERVATORY is a one-story building of brick, faced
with white marble, situated on a small hill on the college grounds and
devoted entirely to the use of the department of Astronomy. THE OB-
SERVATORY House, the residence of the Director of the Observatory, is
nearby. The Observatory, the House, and much of the astronomical
equipment are gifts of the late Mrs. John C. Whitin.
MARY HEMENWAY Hall, on the western border of the campus, was
erected in 1909 as headquarters of the department of Hygiene and
Physical Education when the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics
became a part of Wellesley College.
THE LIBRARY of the College, endowed by Eben Norton Horsford, now
numbers over 219,200 bound volumes, including the departmental
libraries. The books in the General Library building form a collec-
tion chosen primarily for the use of students and instructors in the
college courses in Literature and Languages, History, Economics, So-
ciology, Philosophy, Education, Religious History, and certain of the
sciences. The General Library is open on weekdays from 8:10 A.M. to
9:30 P.M., and on Sundays from 2:30 to 9:30 P.M. Students have
direct access to the shelves. The Library is catalogued by author and
EQUIPMENT
173
subject entries, and the most recent and useful bibliographical aids are
provided. Special effort is made to train students in methods of
research.
The Library subscribes for more than eight hundred American and
foreign periodicals, including daily newspapers representing different
sections of the United States, besides representative British and Con-
tinental dailies.
The Library has also many special collections of great interest and
value to the student doing graduate or other research work. Among
the most valuable of these are the Plimpton Collection, established by
Mr. George A. Plimpton in memory of his wife, Frances Pearsons
Plimpton, of the class of 1884, which comprises over a thousand vol-
umes of Italian books and manuscripts chiefly of the Renaissance; the
Ruskin Collection, the gift of Mr. Charles E. Goodspeed; and the Col-
lection of Early and Rare Editions of English Poetry given for the most
part by Professor George Herbert Palmer.
With the establishment of the Mayling Soong Foundation, it is ex-
pected that a model undergraduate book collection will develop for
teaching the art, culture, history, and philosophy of the Far East,
particularly China.
The Brooks Memorial Room, opened in 1921, provides comfortable
and beautiful surroundings with carefully selected books for leisure
hours of reading.
The following departmental libraries are located in the buildings of
the respective departments: Art, Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Gcol-
ogy, Hygiene, Music, Physics, Psychology, and Zoology.
THE PAGE MEMORIAL SCHOOL on the college campus has two small
buildings and is devoted to the education of young children.
FOUNDERS Hall, a building for lecture rooms and department offices
pertaining to instruction in the liberal arts, was opened for use in 1919.
The hall was built from the Restoration Fund, secured for the College
through trustees, faculty, alumnae, and other friends, and replaces in
some part College Hall, the first and main building of the College. The
building is dedicated as a memorial to the Founders of the College,
Henry Fowle Durant and his wife, Pauline Adeline Durant.
ALUMNAE Hall, built in 1923 as the gift of the alumnae for a recrea-
tion center, contains an auditorium seating 1,570, a ballroom, a library,
committee rooms for the use of alumnae and students, and full equip-
ment for entertaining. There is also a recreation room, known as “The
Well”, which contains a soda fountain, tables for light refreshments,
and a nickelodeon.

EQUIPMENT
Sage Hall was built to house the departments of Botany and Zool-
ogy and Physiology. The first unit for the department of Botany was
erected in 1927, and the Zoology and Physiology unit in 1931. The
principal donor was Mrs. Russell Sage.
HETTY H. R. GREEN HALL, the administration building, was in large
part the gift of Mrs. Green's son and daughter, Colonel Edward H. R.
Green and Mrs. Matthew A. Wilks. It contains the administrative
offices, class and seminar rooms, the faculty assembly hall, and offices of
student organizations. The Galen L. Stone Tower, named for its
donor, contains a carillon which was the gift of Mrs. Charlotte Nichols
Greene.
PENDLETON HALL was opened in 1935. It was named at the request
of the undergraduates in honor of Ellen Fitz Pendleton, President
of the College from 1911 to 1936. This fire-proof building houses the
departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology.
The Recreation Building, containing the GEORGE Howe DAVEN-
PORT SWIMMING POOL, was opened in March, 1939. It is the gift of
many donors, two of whom, Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, gave large sums.
Students and alumnae gave generously to increase the "Swimming Pool
Fund” which accumulated for nearly thirty years. This building serves
as a recreation center for students, faculty, administration, alumnae,
and their guests.
LABORATORIES AND SCIENTIFIC COLLECTIONS
ASTRONOMY. The Whitin Observatory contains two rooms sur-
mounted by rotating domes, twenty-five feet and twelve and one-half
feet in diameter respectively; a transit room; a well-lighted room for
elementary laboratory work; and a room in which is kept the depart-
ment library. In the larger dome room is mounted a twelve-inch
Clark equatorial refracting telescope, which is provided with a filar
micrometer, a polarizing photometer, and an attachment for photo-
graphing the moon. The smaller dome contains a six-inch Clark
refractor, which is provided with an electric driving clock, a filar mi-
crometer, a wedge photometer, and an Evershed protuberance spectro-
scope, and which may be used as a guiding telescope for a small
photographic camera. Both domes are rotated by electric motors.
In the transit room is mounted a Bamberg prismatic transit of three
inches aperture. A four-inch telescope with objective by Browning is
mounted in a south wall of the building, with the eye end inside and the
optic axis parallel to the axis of the Earth; a plane mirror beneath the
object-glass reflects into the latter the light of the object observed.
electrically driven heliostat, mounted in a separate small dome on the
EQUIPMENT
175
roof, reflects sunlight through a lens of 18 feet focal length into the
basement, where, after an additional reflection, it is utilized in a
horizontally mounted Hale spectrohelioscope. The Observatory is
supplied with two Howard sidereal clocks, a Bond mean-time chronom-
eter, and a chronograph, any of which may be connected electrically
through a switch-board with keys near the various telescopes; a
Berger surveyor's transit; a 60-mm. Zeiss tripod telescope; two calculat-
ing machines; a Gaertner comparator for measuring spectrograms; and
a large collection of illustrative apparatus, lantern slides, and photo-
graphs. A flat portion of the roof of the neighboring Sage Hall is fitted
with illuminated tables for the use of astronomy students during naked-
eye study of the sky.
BOTANY. The laboratories of the department of Botany in Sage
Hall are fully equipped for general and special work. Connecting with
the building at three points is a range of modern greenhouses consisting
of a large palm house and fourteen smaller houses. The greenhouses
contribute to all the courses in the department, but are of special
importance in connection with the work in general botany, plant cul-
ture, physiology, ecology, taxonomy, and genetics. Special labora-
tories, and constant-temperature dark-rooms and radiation-rooms, well
equipped with biological, chemical, and physical apparatus, are used
in conjunction with the greenhouses. The department has a wood-
working and machine shop for repairing and making apparatus. The
Susan M. Hallowell Memorial Library is exceptionally well supplied
with reference works and current periodicals. The illustrative collec-
tions comprise an herbarium of over 88,000 sheets, a working museum
of more than 5,000 specimens and models, and a large collection of
charts, lantern slides, and microscopical mounts. The department has
an "Outdoor Laboratory” of small gardens for the use of students in
the beginning course, a Genetics field, and a Botanic Garden and Ar-
boretum. The native flora about Wellesley is easily accessible, fur-
nishing a convenient field for both the taxonomist and ecologist.
CHEMISTRY. The department of Chemistry has in Pendleton Hall
three lecture rooms with complete demonstration tables and apparatus
for special experiments, a seminar room, and a library in memory of
Professor Charlotte Fitch Roberts. Each course is provided with a
laboratory designed and equipped for its special needs. There is a
large dark-room for optical instruments and smaller ones for photo-
graphic work. The laboratories are exceptionally well provided with
apparatus for advanced research in the field of spectrographic analysis,
of both the absorption and emission types. Rooms have been arranged
for special organic experiments, for electrolytic work and for micro-
176
EQUIPMENT
combustions. General research rooms are available which are pro-
vided with equipment adaptable to various experimental problems.
Throughout the building there are systems for hot and cold water,
distilled water, gas, compressed air, vacuum, high-pressure steam,
hydrogen sulfide, and both direct and alternating current, so that these
services are available wherever desired.
GEOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY. The building occupied by the depart-
ment of Geology and Geography contains well-equipped lecture rooms
and laboratories, a small library, and museum and case rooms for
housing the department's large collections of demonstration materials.
The museum and laboratory material of the department includes
a typical collection of dynamical and structural geology specimens,
systematic, mineralogical and petrographic collections, and a wide
variety of fossils. The department has two noteworthy collections.
The first is the Horace I. Johnson Mineral Collection, which consists of
five thousand valuable and beautiful mineral specimens, including
many precious metals and stones. This collection is the gift of the late
Mr. John Merton, and was presented through the Class of 1915 by the
courtesy of Miss M. Helen Merton. The second is the Reverend David
F. Pierce Collection, which includes a complete and rare collection of
building and ornamental stones and many precious and semi-precious
minerals. This collection is the gift of Professor Frederick E. Pierce of
Yale, Miss Anna H. Pierce, and Miss Mary E. Pierce of the Class of
1898.
The maps of the department include many large scale wall maps,
maps of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and complete
files of geologic folios and topographic maps of the United States
Geologic Survey. In addition several thousand topographic maps and
folios are arranged in collections for individual use in the laboratory.
The department has an excellent assortment of lantern slides which
illustrate many phases of geology and geography.
HYGIENE AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION. Mary Hemenway Hall provides
lecture rooms, completely equipped laboratories, photography and ex-
amining rooms, offices and conference rooms. The department library,
in charge of a full-time librarian, affords students unusual opportunities
to make use of the extensive collection of professional books, reference
works, periodicals, and pamphlets. A special endowment for this
library makes possible continual enrichment of the collection.
The Recreation Building, Mary Hemenway Hall, and adjacent ath-
letic fields include the following facilities, which serve as laboratories for
the professional students in Hygiene and Physical Education and for in-
structional classes and recreational activities for students, faculty, and
EQUIPMENT
177
administration: a swimming pool, courts for badminton, basketball,
squash, tennis, and volley ball; an archery range; playing fields for
hockey, lacrosse, and softball; and activity rooms for fencing, gymnas-
tics, folk, modern and tap dance, individual corrective exercise and
modified recreational activities.
Lake Waban makes possible canoeing, crew rowing, skating, and
swimming. Additional facilities include the green of the Outdoor
Theatre and the ballroom of Alumnae Hall for modern dance, a college-
owned golf course, and the bridle paths and riding ring of a nearby
riding club.
MATHEMATICS. The department has a collection of 250 models,
chiefly of thread, paper, plaster, or celluloid. The 50 Brill-Schilling
models include ruled surfaces, skew curves on celluloid, and three
kinematic models of cycloidal curves. There are several large thread
models used with the lantern in the study of skew curves, wire models for
Plateau's films, and many simple models, some of which were made by
members of the department and some by students. There is a fine
transit for the use of classes in trigonometry, a sextant, several types of
modern stereoscopes, a microfilm reader, two computing machines
used in the classes in statistics, a demonstration slide rule, and enough
small inexpensive slide rules for use in grade I courses. The laboratory
is equipped with drawing desks, tee-squares, and drawing boards for
use in descriptive geometry courses.
Physics. The department of Physics has, on the second floor of
Pendleton Hall, large, well-lighted laboratories for general physics,
optics, electricity, and electronics; on the first floor, lecture and reci-
tation rooms, with a central apparatus room, library, and offices. In
the basement are machine and wood shops, laboratories for atomic
physics and meteorology, research rooms, photographic dark-rooms,
and chemical preparation rooms. Lecture tables and laboratories are
fitted with gas, water, compressed air and vacuum systems. Six elec-
trical distribution panels permit the use of direct and alternating cur-
rents of various voltages in all parts of the building.
The equipment is thoroughly modern. The lecture apparatus is
sufficient to permit a wide range of experiments. Duplication of ap-
paratus permits close coördination between lectures and laboratory
work in the elementary courses. The department is especially well
equipped for advanced courses in the fields of optics, electricity, in-
cluding high frequency oscillations, electronics, and atomic physics.
PsyCHOLOGY. The laboratory in Pendleton Hall consists of a number
of small rooms in which an observer and subject may work on elemen-
tary problems; several larger laboratories for advanced problems re-
178
EQUIPMENT
quiring more elaborate apparatus; specially designed rooms for studies
in visual, auditory, and olfactory sensations; facilities for photography;
a small but well-fitted workshop. There is also a room equipped for
animal experimentation. The money from the Sanford Fund is being
used to purchase all apparatus necessary for a modern laboratory.
The library and seminar room is dedicated to the memory of Eleanor
Acheson McCulloch Gamble, former professor of psychology.
ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The department of Zoology and Physi-
ology occupies in Sage Hall lecture rooms, laboratories, research rooms,
a library-a memorial to Caroline B. Thompson-a museum, and a
vivarium which includes mammal rooms and runways and a large
aquarium room containing frog and turtle pools, tanks for salt and fresh
water forms and for tropical fishes.
The museum material includes teaching collections of fishes, amphibi-
ans, reptiles, birds and mammals, and many fine anatomical and embry-
ological models. Invertebrates are represented by extensive collec-
tions of insects and shells and models of important types.
RESIDENCES
The college residences are grouped into several units on and off the
campus.
In all houses the rooms are provided with the necessary
furniture, including rugs and desk lamps.
The Hazard Quadrangle consists of four houses having approxi-
mately 88 students in each: Beebe, Cazenove, Pomeroy, and Shafer
Halls.
Munger Hall is adjacent to the Hazard Quadrangle and accommo-
dates 105 students.
The Tower Court group receives its name from the largest of its three
buildings (which accommodates 216) and includes, also, Claflin Hall
(with 95 students) and Severance Hall (with 125).
Stone and Olive Davis Halls form one building, though each half is
operated as an independent unit for 80 students.
Norumbega Hall (with 50 students) is centrally located on the hill
with Green, Founders, and Pendleton Halls, and the Farnsworth Art
Building
Dower House and Homestead are campus residences, each accom-
modating about 35 freshmen who take their meals at Olive Davis Hall.
Seven houses in the village-Crofton, Eliot, Elms, Washington,
Webb, Little, and Noanett-form a residence unit for approximately
200 freshmen.
Fiske House, the Graduate Club House, accommodating about 25,
is the social headquarters for all graduate students.
EQUIPMENT

Physician, are open to all students without charge for a period not ex-
ceeding seven days, provided no extra service is required. An infirmary
fee of $4.00 a day is charged for periods exceeding seven days. Charges
for extra services will be determined by the amount required.
Arrangements for a group student health and accident insurance
policy are made by the College with a reputable insurance company.
The College allowance of seven free days in the infirmary per year
together with the benefits of the group student health and accident in-
surance, should meet the greater part of the necessary medical expenses
ordinarily incurred at the College. Details in regard to this insurance
will be mailed to students by the Assistant Treasurer, who will be glad
to answer questions about it. This insurance is strongly recommended
to students, but is not a requirement.
Note:—Every student should also plan for an annual expenditure of
$30 to $50 for the purchase of books and supplies.
No student may receive a diploma until a satisfactory settlement of all her
college fees has been made.
SCHOLARSHIPS, LOANS, AND PRIZES
Scholarships maintained by income from permanent funds listed be-
low are awarded annually to undergraduate students, and grants are
made froin other funds which the trustees set aside for this purpose each
year. The students who qualify for these scholarships are, in the main,
those who have been in Wellesley College at least a year, but some
freshmen and a few students who transfer from other institutions receive
grants. Awards are made in recognition of intellectual ability, of good
college citizenship and character, and of genuine financial need. The
magnitude of the scholarships ranges in general from $100 to $500.
Applications from students in college must be filed with the Dean of
Students, who is Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Scholarships,
on forms furnished for the purpose and in accordance with the instruc-
tions posted at the beginning of the second semester.
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR FRESHMEN:
A limited number of scholarships are offered to incoming freshmen.
Awards are based on financial need, scholastic ability, and promise of
good college citizenship. There are fifteen Pendleton Scholarships of
$600. As funds permit, sums ranging from $100 to $400 are awarded
to other freshman applicants.
Applications from all candidates for admission should be made to the
Dean of Freshmen before March 15 of the year of admission.
More detailed information about scholarships may be obtained by
writing directly to the Dean of Freshmen.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT:
The Placement Office offers assistance to students who wish to earn
money toward their college expenses. The types of employment are
mainly clerical work, tutoring, library work, assisting in the various
offices of the College, and some domestic work. While the Placement
Office makes every effort to obtain places for those who wish to work,
it cautions students against depending upon this source for any regular
or considerable income. Such employment makes a distinct draft upon
strength and time, and it is hardly to be advised for the freshman year,
THE WELLESLEY STUDENTS' Aid SOCIETY:
This organization is maintained by alumnae and former students of
the College, aided by the faculty and undergraduates, as their contribu-
tion towards keeping the opportunity of Wellesley open to students of
moderate means. Awards are made both in gifts and in loans, and
usually in some combination of the two. These awards are made on

184
SCHOLARSHIPS
practically the same basis as the college scholarships and supplement
them for necessary college expenses. They ordinarily range from $50
to $200. Loans and occasionally gifts in small sums, $5 to $25, are also
made for incidental expenses and emergencies.

SCHOLARSHIPS
HONOR SCHOLARSHIPS
Honor Scholarships (without stipend) have been established by the College
for the purpose of giving recognition to a high degree of excellence in academic
work. These honors fall into two classes: students in the first, or higher class,
are termed Durant Scholars; students in the second class are termed Wellesley
College Scholars.
These honors are awarded to seniors on the basis of two and one-half years'
work, to juniors on the basis of one and one-half years' work. The standard in
each case is absolute, not competitive.

HISTORICAL SKETCH
WEL
JELLESLEY College is one of that group of women's colleges estab-
lished in the nineteenth century to offer to young women the edu-
cational opportunities “equivalent to those usually provided in colleges
for
young men.” The motive of its founder, Henry Fowle Durant, was,
however, something more than the enrichment of the experience of
young women for their own sake. Addressing the first students in the
fall of 1875 he said, “You mistake altogether the significance of the
movement of which you are a part if you think this is simply a question
of a college education for girls. I believe that God's hand is in it; ...
that He is calling to womanhood to come up higher, to prepare herself
for great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life, for noblest usefulness."
To the end of preparing women for positions of responsibility, Mr.
Durant insisted from the beginning on the maintenance of high aca-
demic standards, and of healthy community life in beautiful surround-
ings. He built an impressive College Hall on his own spacious estate
twelve miles west of Boston, and spared no pains to make his gift con-
tribute to the aesthetic development of students. He began to beautify
the four hundred acre campus which has become one of Wellesley's dis-
tinctive assets. He encouraged the inclusion in the student body of rep-
resentatives from all parts of the country and from foreign lands. He
placed more emphasis on personal quality than on the accident of eco-
nomic status, and he maintained a real democracy within the college
family. He opened unusual professional opportunities to women on
the faculty. He introduced laboratory work in science before it was
widely recognized as academically necessary. He recognized the sig-
nificance of the arts in education and encouraged "learning by doing.”
He assumed that religion was a normal part of the life of educated peo-
ple and made provision for its study and expression in the program of
the new community.
From the beginning the Board of Trustees has been composed of men
and women whose interests have been far-reaching in New England and
around the world. The first board included the President of Yale Col-
lege, Chancellor of the University of the City of New York, Dean of the
Episcopal Theological School at Cambridge, President of Boston
University, a professor of the Rochester Theological Seminary and of
Andover Theological Seminary, two pastors, and a former Governor
of Massachusetts. The roster has been continuously noteworthy for the
calibre of the persons who have contributed of their time, their profes-
sional experience, their money to strengthen the College. The present
board includes educators as well as financiers, lawyers, an architect,
a doctor, businessmen—men and women of wide cultural interests se-
lected for their expert contribution. It is a working board. Three of
its regular members are nominated by vote of the Alumnae Association.
22
HISTORICAL SKETCH
23
An unusual feature of organization is the membership of a “faculty
trustee" who is not a member of the faculty but is nominated by the Aca-
demic Council.
The history of the College falls into two fairly distinct periods, before
and after the College Hall Fire. The College was chartered on March
17, 1870, but the planning of the program and the construction of Col-
lege Hall required five years of effort and the opening did not occur until
September, 1875. In a surprisingly short period, under the leadership
of President Ada Howard (1875-1881) and Alice Freeman (1881-1887),
the institution became established as a well-known college. It bor-
rowed ideas and methods from various institutions, notably Mount
Holyoke Seminary's program of domestic work for each student. It
drew heavily on the resources of Harvard University but at once as-
sumed responsibility for copying nothing blindly and for introducing a
type of instruction which gave scope to the initiative of students.
During the presidencies of Helen Shafer (1887–1894) and Julia Irvine
(1894–1899) the present curriculum of the College took shape and the
experimental venture in higher education for women became estab-
lished as a permanent part of the educational scene. President Caro-
line Hazard (1899–1910) brought to the academically mature College
the graciousness of the artist. Music, art, gracious living were re-
emphasized as important factors in a community of educated people.
On the night of March 17, 1914, College Hall burned to the ground.
The orderly evacuation of the building with no injury to any occupant
won world-wide fame for the already well-known College. In the
emergency created by this catastrophe President Ellen Fitz Pendleton
(1911-1936) came to the position of leadership which made her indeed
the builder which she will always be in the grateful memory of Welles-
ley women. Within twenty-five years the College grew from an in-
adequately housed, financially handicapped institution to a beautifully
equipped and well-endowed college. More significantly, Miss Pendle-
ton guided the reorganization of the faculty into a democratically con-
trolled policy-making body which worked consistently to maintain and
develop a vital curriculum and community life. She assisted in the for-
mation of a vigorous Alumnae Association and presided over the mag-
nificent efforts of the trustees and alumnae to raise enough money to
rebuild, expand, and endow the College.
During the very years of Wellesley's urgent need, the efforts of all
its members were directed to the war service of four overseas units.
Wellesley is no "ivory tower" to which people withdraw from contact
with world needs. Her fourteen thousand alumnae, engaged in every
kind of responsible task, prove that fact. The register of graduates lists
Wellesley women living in each state of the United States and in fifty-
one foreign lands.
Wellesley College started with three hundred students, most of them
in a preparatory department which was part of the College until 1879.
It has become a college for fifteen hundred students, with fifty or sixty
24
HISTORICAL SKETCH
graduate students. Commensurate with this growth, the external as-
pects of the College have changed almost completely. Starting with
one building, it now has forty-seven. It began with Mr. Durant's
private library of 8,000 volumes; its present library numbers over
226,000 voluines. Its one gymnasium rooin has been replaced by two
large buildings to provide instructional and recreational facilities for
the graduate departinent of Hygiene and Physical Education and for
the cnlarged undergraduate group.
With the coming of war in December, 1941, faculty and students alike
turned their attention toward preparing the College for its part in the
war effort. Changes were made in the lighting of buildings and grounds
to conform to the dimout regulations of this region, and a college organi-
zation for air-raid protection was developed in close coöperation with
the Town of Wellesley. The students modified their extracurricular
activities to free time for various kinds of community or war service.
Also, a faculty-student committee was organized to encourage students
to use vacations for this purpose. Students have met the shortage of
employees by doing domestic work in the houses coöperatively. From
October, 1943, to September, 1944, a branch of the Navy Supply
Corps School located at Harvard University was housed in Cazenove
and Pomeroy Halls.
In the midst of these changes in the daily routine and in the external
aspects of college life, members of the faculty and administration are
making every effort to safeguard the integrity of the academic work
of the College and to play their part in maintaining the intellectual
disciplines underlying our civilization.
ADMISSION
DMISSION to Wellesley College is competitive. From the group
of candidates, the Board of Admission selects those who give
the best evidence of possessing intellectual interest and ability and the
qualities of character and personality necessary for college citizenship.
There is a definite limit on the number of students who can be admitted
in any year since the College has facilities for only fifteen hundred
students,
APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION
All communications concerning admission should be addressed to the
Chairman for the Board of Admission, Wellesley College, Wellesley 81,
Massachusetts.
Forms for application will be furnished on request. An application
fee of ten dollars is required of all applicants and no registration is re-
corded until the fee is received. If the candidate cancels her registra-
tion or does not enter the College for any reason, the fee is not refunded.
but it may be transferred to apply to a later year if the request for the
transfer is received within a reasonable time after the beginning of the
year for which the candidate is registered to enter college.
A report from the applicant's physician showing that she is organically
sound and in good health, together with a certificate of vaccination and
any required tests, must be filed with the Board of Admission well in
advance of the date of entrance. The College reserves the right to re-
ject any candidate who, in the opinion of the college physicians, is not
fitted for work in the college community, and to dismiss at any time a
student who does not coöperate fully with the college health officers.
ADMISSION TO THE FRESIIMAN CLASS
Application for admission to the freshman class may be made to the
Chairman of the Board of Admission at any time up to March 1 of the
year of entrance. A student is advised to make application at the be-
ginning of her secondary school course and she is urged to do so not
later than the fall of her junior year in secondary school so that her
school program may be approved before it is too late to make schedule
changes. Since rooms are assigned according to the date of application,
there is an added advantage in early registration. The date of applica-
tion is not, however, a factor in determining admission.
In selecting the freshman class, the Board of Admission reviews
schools records, recommendations, information from the candidate
concerning her interests and plans of study, and the results of the
Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Tests. From a large number of
applicants a class of about four hundred is chosen. Candidates will
receive notification of the results of their applications late in May.

ADMISSION
Students who are interested in adinission should read carefully the
recommendations concerning secondary school subjects to be offered for
entrance and the statement concerning the required College Board tests.
ADMISSION SUBJECTS
For admission to Wellesley College 16 units* of secondary school
work are required. These units should be distributed mainly in the
fields of English, foreign language, mathematics, history, and science.
Candidates are advised to plan their programs early in their high
school course, taking into consideration the requirements for the B.A.
degree which are described on pages 32 to 34. The Board of Admission
will be glad to give advice or suggestions concerning the selection of
school courses. A student who is not certain that her entrance units
will be acceptable to Wellesley should write to the Board for information.
The courses listed below are recommended as providing a generally
satisfactory basis for work at Wellesley College:
English.
4 units
Foreign Languages.
5 units
It is recommended that these 5 units be divided as follows: Latin
or Greek, 3 units; a modern language (French, German, Spanish,
or Italian), 2 units. Candidates from schools which recommend
other language programs are asked to write to the Board of Ad-
mission for approval of the distribution of their units. No credit
will be given for one unit of a foreign language.
Mathematics ..
3 units
These units are to consist of Algebra, 2 units, and Plane Geom-
etry, 1. The second unit of Algebra is completed in some schools
in a half year. When only two units of mathematics are offered
for entrance, one must be in Algebra, the other in Geometry.
History . .
1 unit
This is the minimum requirement. The unit may be in any
branch of history. European History is especially recommended
for students interested primarily in languages, literature, and the
arts.
Science . .
1 unit
This unit may be in Biology, Physics, or Chemistry. General
Science may be counted as one of the free elective units.
Elective subjects
2 units
Additional units in any of the subjects listed above may be in-
cluded; or courses in Art, Biblical History, and Social Studies,
such as Problems of Democracy, Economics, or general survey
courses, may make up the free units.
Music may be offered for one, two, or three units as follows:
one unit, fundamentals of music; two units, fundamentals of
music and literature of music, or fundamentals and practical
music (literature of music and practical music may not be offered
* A unit represents one year's study in any one subject, constituting approxi-
mately a quarter of a full year's work.
ADMISSION

except with fundamentals); three units, fundamentals of music,
literature of music, and practical music.
Since Wellesley College is interested in having students from all parts
of this country and from forcign schools, the need for having flexible
entrance requirements is recognized. The Board of Admission wel-
comes froin school principals information about unusual curricular
plans or new courses which secondary schools recommend to their
students or about changes in the curriculum which have been intro-
duced recently. Unusual courscs or entrance programs must have the
approval of the Board before thcy can be accepted for admission.
The decision of the Board of Adinission concerning a candidate will
in all cases depend on the general excellence of her school record and
recommendations and on her relative standing in the required entrance
tests.
SCHOOL RECORDS
Complete records of a student's work in secondary school are re-
quired. Blanks for the preliminary records are sent to school prin-
cipals a year in advance of the student's completion of preparatory
work. Blanks for supplementary reports are sent during the year of
final preparation for college.
The school record must be suppleinented by statements from the
school principal concerning the special abilities and interests of the
student, power of sustained work, good health habits, integrity, sense of
responsibility, initiative and self-reliance in work and in social action.
The College wishes to be informed of circumstances which may have
furthered or interfered with a student's work and of special honors and
accomplishments during the student's secondary school course.
TESTS FOR ADMISSION
All candidates for entrance to the freshman class are required to take
the Scholastic Aptitude Test and three Achievement Tests given by
the College Entrance Examination Board. Application for these tests
must be made directly to the College Board in Princeton, New Jersey,
by the candidate herself. The dates for making application and the
address of the Board are given below.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test, which includes both verbal and mathe-
matical sections, is designed to test a student's general aptitude for col-
lege work. No special preparation for it is necessary. It is recom-
mended that this test be taken by a candidate in June of her junior
year in secondary school whenever this is possible.
Achievement Tests are given in English, Social Studics, four foreign
languages, and three sciences. (See page 28 for the complete list of
tests.) Candidates for admission to Wellesley are required to take the
English Test and two others chosen from different fields. These tests
should be taken in 1945 on April 7 so that the Wellesley Board of

ADMISSION
Admission will have the results when it meets in May to select the
freshman class. The Scholastic Aptitude Test inay also be taken at
this time if it has not been taken earlier.
Attention is called to the fact that thc Achievement Tests are designed
to be taken in stride without extensive review or extra study and without
any speeding up of the school program. The result of each test is
judged in relation to the number of years a candidate has spent studying
the subject.
In addition to taking the Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Tests,
candidates from New York State may submit for admission their grades
on the Regents' examinations. Candidates from foreign countries are
expected to take the College Entrance Examination Board tests if it is
possible for them to make arrangements to do so.

ADMISSION
ADMISSION TO ADVANCED STANDING
If a student has maintained an excellent record in a recognized col-
lege and has special interests which she can follow at Wellesley Col-
lege, she may apply for admission to the sophomore or the junior class.
The number of students who can be admitted with advanced standing
in any year, however, is very limited, and only students with unusually
strong records are encouraged to apply.
A form for making application for admission should be obtained
from the Chairman of the Board of Admission before May 1 of the year
of entrance. A registration fee of ten dollars is required of all candi-
dates. This fee cannot be refunded if a student is not admitted. A
candidate must have completed the work recommended for admission
to the freshman class (see page 26) and at least a full year of highly
satisfactory work at another college. She should be entitled to honor-
able dismissal from the college which she has attended and should be
recommended by her instructors.
All candidates for admission to advanced standing are required to
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test of the College Entrance Examination
Board. Applicants who have taken this test should request the College
Board to send the results to Wellesley College. Those who have not
taken it should plan to do so as soon as possible. Information con-
cerning application for the test is given on page 27 of this Catalogue.
Other aptitude tests are not acceptable as substitutes.
A student must be in residence at least two years at Wellesley College
to obtain the B.A. degree, one of which must be the senior year. The
work of these two years must include all the prescribed work (see page
33) not covered by the credentials submitted and such courses as are
needed to meet the requirements for distribution and concentration
(see page 33). Credit for courses completed at another college is
tentatively granted early in the first year of residence. The final
determination of credit is not made until the end of the year
since the
success of advanced standing candidates with work at Wellesley is an
important consideration in deciding upon credit.
The selection of applicants for admission with advanced standing
will be made in July of the year in which entrance is desired.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE M.A. AND M.S.
DEGREES
Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Educa-
tion, or Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education must be
graduates of Wellesley College or of other institutions of satisfactory
standing, and must present adequate credentials signifying their ability
to carry on the work for the degree.
Application for admission as a graduate student in any department
should be made upon forms which will be furnished by the Dean of
Graduate Students on request. It is desirable that the application be
ADMISSION
31
sent by March first of the year in which the student proposes to enter.
It should be accompanied (1) by the official record of courses and
grades, (2) by a copy of the catalogue of the institution attended,
marked to indicate the courses taken.
Graduate scholarships are described on page 167.
For requirements for the M.A. and M.S. degrees see page 37. A cir-
cular containing full information for graduate students will be sent on
application to the Dean of Graduate Students.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE CERTIFICATE IN HYGIENE
AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION
A two years' course, especially designed for the training of teachers
of hygiene and physical education, and leading to the certificate of the
Department of Hygiene and Physical Education, is offered to gradu-
ates of approved colleges who meet the requirements. Full information
wiil be found on page 106.
Correspondence should be addressed to the Dean of Graduate
Students.
DEGREES
The following degrees are conferred by the Trustees upon recon-
mendation of the Academic Council:
Bachelor of Arts.
Master of Arts.
Master of Arts in Education.
Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education.
Certificate in Hygiene and Physical Education.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.A. DEGREE
In constructing the curriculum of which the requirements are given below,
the faculty was guided by a belief that a student's four years in college should
give her several specific sorts of training. The prescribed work is planned to
assure her possession of certain skills which are of general use, and to add to
the information which she has acquired before coming to college further in-
formation considered of fundamental importance. Thus the prescribed work
in English Composition and Speech is designed to assure her having accuracy
and effectiveness in speaking and writing English. The prescription in Hy-
giene affords the student a knowledge of the laws of health. The prescribed
work in Biblical History gives a knowledge of the historical basis of Christianity.
The requirement of work for distribution is made with the purpose of securing
for each student some acquaintance with methods of work and ways of thinking
in various representative fields of knowledge. The requirement of work for con-
centration is made in order that the student shall make a reasonably thorough
study of one field of knowledge. The curriculum is so planned that a student
has the opportunity to elect without restriction a number of courses to suit her
individual need and interest.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must complete before graduation
the equivalent of one hundred and twenty semester hours, and have
in addition a reading knowledge of one of the following: French. Ger-
man, Greek, Italian, Latin, Spanish.
The test of the reading knowledge of one of these foreign languages
consists in the attainment of a sufficiently high score in the College
Entrance Examination Board Achieveinent Test in French, German,
Latin, or Spanish, or in the examination given by Wellesley College in
Greek or Italian. Students may gain exemption from further tests by
obtaining a good rating in the College Board test submitted for ad-
mission. In general the choice of the language to be offered is left to
the student, but any department offering work for a major may require
its major students to pass the examination in one particular language or
in one of any two or more specified languages. Students majoring
in a foreign language will be tested in a reading knowledge of a second
language; in this case students may postpone the examination until the
beginning of the senior year.

COURSE EXAMINATIONS
An examination period occurs at the end of each semester. Exami-
nations for the removal of conditions and deficiencies and for advanced
standing may be taken during any examination period and at other
specified times.
A student who wishes to take an examination upon a course which is
not a part of her approved schedule for the year, inust apply to the
College Recorder for the requisite card of admission to the examination.
STANDARD FOR GRADUATION
A certain quality grade is required for graduation and, for the pur-
pose of determining this quality grade, numerical values called "points"
are given to the grade letters as follows: for grade A, three points for
each semester hour of the course in which the grade is received; for
grade B, two points; for grade C, one point; for grade D (passing), no
points; for a grade below D, no points and not counted in hours toward
a degree. In order to be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of
Arts a student must in each semester attain as many quality points as
the hours she carries, i.e., a credit ratio of 1.0. (The credit ratio is the
ratio of the number of quality points earned to the semester hours
carried.) Deficiency of points in any semester may be made good only
in accordance with regulations adopted by the faculty. In general,
students who are deficient in quality points at the end of the third year
or who are otherwise not of diploma-grade standing will not be per-
mitted to continue.
The College reserves the right to require the withdrawal of students
whose academic standing is not satisfactory, and of those who for any
other reason have shown themselves to be not in accord with the ideals
and standards which the College seeks to maintain.
HONORS IN A SPECIAL FIELD
Recognition of the desire of certain students to carry on consecutive
and somewhat intensive work along the line of their particular interests
has led to the introduction of a plan for Honors in a Special Field.
A student electing to study for Honors will choose a Field of Special
Study and will work in that field under the direction of one or more of
the instructors concerned who will advise her on the possible develop-
ment of her field and will guide her in the carrying on of independent
work within it.
Students who wish to become candidates for Honors may apply in
the spring of their sophomore or junior year to the committee appointed
to consider these applications.
DEGREES
35
DEPARTMENTAL HONORS
A plan for Departmental Honors has been established to enable cer-
tain students to enrich the work of the major subject by engaging in a
program of supplementary directed work in the senior year. A can-
didate for Departmental Honors will carry a normal senior program
supplemented by work in the major subject done under the special di-
rection of one or more instructors. The supplementary work will be
planned to suit the needs and interests of the individual student.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELECTING COURSES
The program in the freshman year is as follows:

not be necessary. Students are held responsible for observing the
requirements for the degree and the proper sequence of courses.
PREPARATION FOR WAR AND Postwar SERVICE
In the present crisis each student will wish to prepare for usefulness
in the war effort and at the same time to educate herself to bear a re-
sponsible part in furthering the best in our national life both now and
after the war. Many will wish to have a definite part in reconstruction
work. These aims need not be in conflict if programs of study are
planned intelligently. Each student should choose the major sub-
ject best suited to her abilities and interests since by so doing she will
achieve her best intellectual development. Study in certain fields,
notably the sciences, the social sciences, and the inodern languages,
may prepare for essential war work in industry or government, or for
service in the period of reconstruction. The student whose major study
is not directed to these ends may in her free electives or in extracurricu-
lar courses prepare for useful work upon graduation. The attention
of all students is called to the critical shortage of teachers. Graduates
of the liberal arts colleges are especially well qualified to meet the need
for this important work.
For all students it is especially necessary to plan a carefully co-
ordinated program since certain combinations of courses lead directly
to important work requiring college preparation. The class deans,
members of the faculty, and the secretaries of the Placement Office
will gladly give information and assistance to students in making
their plans.
Provision is inade for individual students to complete the work for
the degree in three or three and one-half years by carrying extra hours
and by attending summer sessions at colleges of recognized standing.
The curriculum, described in this bulletin, will be supplemented by
extracurricular courses sponsored by the Committee on War Activities
and directed toward the war effort. The extracurricular program
will include the following courses: First Aid, Current Events, Type-
writing and Shorthand.
PRE-PROFESSIONAL COURSES
Students who plan to apply for admission to professional schools after
leaving Wellesley College should consult their class deans about appro-
priate electives early in the course.
Each student who is planning to study medicine is advised to confer
with her class dean before the beginning of her sophomore year. Enter-
ing students are advised to elect two pre-medical sciences in the fresh-
man year. In general, requirements for admission to medical schools
of Class A can be met by eighteen hours in Chemistry and twelve hours
in Physics and Zoology respectively, but each student is advised to study
carefully the requirements for the particular school which she has
chosen. Attention is called to the fact that twenty-four hours are re-

quired as a basis for the general examination in any department. It is,
however, possible to fulfill the ininiinum requirement for inedical
schools, and to take the general examination in an entirely different
field.
Students planning to prepare for work in hospital or public health
laboratories should begin both Chemistry and Zoology in their freshman
year in order to have the necessary foundation for advanced courses.
The departments of Botany, Chemistry, Physics, and Zoölogy should
be consulted concerning combinations of courses in later years of the
college course.
PREPARATION FOR TEACHING
A student wishing special preparation for teaching may plan a five
year integrated course leading to a Bachelor of Arts at the end of the
fourth year and a Master of Arts in Education at the end of the fifth.
The courses in student's field of concentration and her free electives
will be chosen to provide preparation in the subjects which she espe-
cially desires to teach. Her program will include also courses in Edu-
cation which will enable her to meet requirements for certification in
many states. Practice teaching will be included in the work of the
fifth year.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.A. AND M.S. DEGREES
Wellesley College offers graduate work leading to the degrees of
Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Science in
Hygiene and Physical Education. The work required of a candidate is
considered to be the equivalent of twenty-four hours of college work.
In general, a candidate is required to work in one department. The
program includes no fewer than two full courses of Grade III or their
equivalent, and may include a thesis embodying the results of original
research or reports based on independent work. A candidate for a
Master's degree is required to have a working knowledge of either
French or German, to be tested by examination at entrance. Individual
departments may require a second language. At least one year of
graduate study is required of all candidates, but more time may be
needed for the completion of the work. One year in residence is re-
quired of all candidates except graduates of Wellesley College who have
done the work at some institution which does not grant a Master's de-
gree to women.
Information regarding requirements for admission, theses, final ex-
aminations, etc., will be found in the Graduate Circular which will be
sent on application to the Dean of Graduate Students.
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
1944-45
The following courses of instruction are offered by the several de
of any course not chosen by at least six students.
All courses are classified in grades I, II, III; grade I indicating ele-
mentary courses and grade III the most advanced courses. Grade I
courses are numbered 101, etc.; grade II courses 201, etc.; grade III
courses 301, etc.

HistorY OF ART
Many of the courses in Art include some laboratory work in the one or more
mediums with which the course is concerned. The department believes that
laboratory training has great value in developing observation and understand-
ing of problems of art, and for this reason requires it of majoring students. It
should be stated, however, that no particular natural aptitude is required and
that the work is scaled to the student's ability.

not appear, but it is to be expected that the student will show as basic
to her understanding of religious developments:
1. A broad knowledge of the outlines of the political history involved.
2. A grasp of the principles, procedure and results of historical and
literary criticism.
3. Such a knowledge of the content of the Bible as will make it pos-
sible for her to illustrate concretely her general statements.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
The courses in Botany are intended to present to the general student
a basis for understanding and interpreting the phenomena of the world
of living things and, at the same time, to furnish a foundation for stu-
dents who plan to follow professionally some phase of biological work.
The major in Botany is based on 101 or on two of the following:
202, 203, 204, 206. The grade Ill courses, while still emphasizing
fundamental biological principles, give more specific training in differ-
ent phases of botanical science. A variety of sequences of courses
is available. Any member of the department will be glad to talk with
students concerning the department courses and supplementing courses
that will most nearly fill their needs. Those students who are planning
to continue their botanical work after graduation along lines of teaching,
research, agricultural and experiment station work, in various kinds of
technical laboratory work, landscape gardening, horticulture, or inu-
seum work, etc., will find it advisable to discuss their plans with the
department as early as possible in their course.
For students interested in bacteriology, public health work, or medi-
cal laboratory work, 308 and 312 present the basic viewpoints and
techniques of bacteriology upon which may be added the more rech-
nical training obtainable in graduate or professional schools. Other
courses, such as 304, 306, and 307, in this department, as well as courses
in Chemistry and Zoology, supplement these offerings.
56
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
Course 350 is open for independent study or advanced work in any
field in which the student has had a grade III course in the department.
Courses 308 and 312 may form a part of a Botany inajor that includes
a year of grade III other than, or in addition to, 309–310 or 350.
The department offerings in Landscape Design, 309–310, may form
a part of a Botany inajor that includes a year of grade III other than, or
in addition to, 308 or 312.
Botany majors may, under certain conditions, obtain permission from
the Chemistry department to take Chemistry 301 after having had
Chemistry 101.
The department will accept a reading knowledge of any of the foreign
languages prescribed by the College to fulfill its requirements, but of
these it considers French, German, or Latin to be of special value.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination aims to test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles and the basic facts of plant science and to de-
termine her ability to correlate and utilize this information.
A sufficient number of questions will be given to provide a choice for
every student, no matter what combination of courses she has elected in
her major.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
Members of the department will be glad to advise students concern-
ing courses which would best prepare for graduate study, for teaching,
for work in industrial or hospital laboratories, for nursing, or for public
health work.
Premedical students are referred to the requirements for pre-profes-
sional training as given on page 36.
The American Chemical Society has established a set of requirements
which it considers essential for the training of chemists, especially for
industrial work. Students wishing to meet the standard of an accredited
chemist as defined by this Society should consult the chemistry depart-
ment.
For any major in chemistry one of the following sequences of courses
is essential: 101, 201, 202, and 301; or 103, 202, and 301. Any other
60
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
courses in the department may be added to these to complete the twenty-
four-hour major. Such a major with the related work in the field of
concentration will give an adequate background for admission to gradu-
ate school and to medical schools of grade A.
It is advisable that all students majoring in chemistry should complete
at least one year of college physics and one year of college mathematics,
and acquire a reading knowledge of French and German before the
senior year. They will be required to pass a reading knowledge exam-
ination in German, or French.
Students not majoring in chemistry who intend to use their chemistry
after graduation will be recommended by the department only if they
have completed at least eighteen hours of chemistry.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The aim of the general examination in chemistry will be to test the
student's knowledge of the fundamental principles and important
facts of chemistry, and her ability to correlate and apply this material.
CLASSICAL ARCHÆOLOGY
The departments of Art, Greek, and Latin offer a program of study
constituting a major in Archäology. The purpose of this major is to
correlate the courses in ancient art with those in Greek and Latin lan-
guage and literature, in order to provide opportunity for a more com-
prehensive study and understanding of ancient civilization than is
available within any one of the separate departments. This major will
also serve as a basic preparation for those students contemplating
graduate and field work in archæology.
The work for concentration should normally include forty-eight hours
divided as follows: eighteen hours in Art; either eighteen hours in Greek
and six hours in Latin or eighteen hours in Latin and six in Greek; six
hours in Ancient History (203 or 204). From the courses elected in
Art, Greek, and Latin, thirty hours will be chosen to form the major.
The choice will be made by the student in consultation with the chair-
man in charge of the work in archæology.
All courses in the Greek and Latin departments may be counted in
the field for concentration, except Greek 203, 204, 207, and Latin 104,
105.
In the Art department the following courses may be counted:
101, 209, 314, 318, 320. In addition to these, 350 work may be taken
in any one of the three departments concerned. The complete pro-
grain should include six hours of grade III work in Art and six hours of
grade II work in either Greek or Latin.
Sorne knowledge of geology is useful for field archæology; chemistry
is valuable both for field and museum work.
A reading knowledge of French, German, or Italian is required for
this major.
The work of the Archæology major will be supervised by a joint
ECONOMICS
61
comunittee composed of representatives from the three departments
concerned. Students should have their prograin approved by the
chairman of this coinmittee who will be Associate Professor Dorothy M.
Robathan for the year 1944-45.
The general examination will cover the thirty liours of work included
in the major. It will be given in two parts, one on art, the other on
language and literature.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
1. MAJOR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
Distribution of work: Course 101, six hours of grade II work, and two
courses of grade III, form the usual sequence for the minimum English
Literature major. It is possible to begin a major in the junior year
by entering a grade II course. Concentration on any one period or
type is not advised for majors. Proper distribution should be insured
by conference with the 101 instructor, and with the chairman of the
department in the spring of the sophomore year.
The following courses in English Literature are not counted in the
major: 104, 210, 212, 213.
Related courses: Related courses for concentration may be chosen from
many fields. Knowledge of at least one foreign literature, and ability
to read certain foreign languages, ancient and modern, is of great value
to the student of English Literature. Understanding of the history of
the periods in which the literature is studied is also important. In
English Composition special attention is called to 201, 208, 303; in the
classical departments, to Greek 203, 204, 207, and Latin 105, dealing
with Greek and Latin literature in translation; in Italian, to 103, Intro-
duction to the Study of the Italian Renaissance. The attention of stu-
dents who are interested in the teaching of English is called to Educa-
tion 307, The Teaching of English in the Secondary School.
78
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
The examination will consist of questions covering the courses in-
cluded in the English Literature major. In this list there will be a
sufficient number of questions to insure a fair opportunity for choice.
Each student will select the questions dealing with the subjects she has
studied in her own major. The questions will seek to test: (1) The
student's knowledge of authors, works, types in the periods included in
her major; (2) her intelligence and accuracy in correlating her knowl-
edge; (3) her independence of judgment and her literary discrimination.
II. MAJOR IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: English Composition 101, required of all stu-
dents, will not be counted as part of the major in Composition. For
a twenty-four-hour major the following combination is recommended:
two or more semester courses of grade II (see restrictions under indi-
vidual courses); twelve hours of grade III, in which 303 must be in-
cluded. At least six hours above grade I of English Literature must
be included.
Note: No two writing courses may be taken at the same time, but
English Composition 303 and courses in English Literature may be
taken simultaneously with a writing course. Courses 209 and 312 in
English Literature are counted as courses in Composition, and may be
included in a twenty-four-hour major in English Composition together
with six hours of English Literature above grade I. Work in Compo-
sition for the senior year of such a major must be of grade III: 304 or 350
(year); or some combination of 300, 301, 302, 305, 350 (semester).
Related courses: Students intending to teach or to engage in literary
work should include in their program additional courses in English
Literature. Some knowledge of Latin and Greek literature in the
original or in translation is highly important for a teacher of English,
as is a background of history, especially English history. The attention
of students who are interested in the teaching of English is called to
Education 307, The Teaching of English in the Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
The general examination in English Composition will include ques-
tions on the theory“on the principles of craftsmanship-underlying
the specific courses the student has taken; it will include a study of the
forms of description, narration, and exposition in their general aspects;
a study of differing types of essay, of biography, of criticism; a study of
the historical development of the sentence, of the paragraph, and of the
linguistic elements composing our vocabulary. The student will be
expected to organize her answers clearly and to write with reasonable
fluency and finish. Supplementary reading and detailed instructions
will be given in a department statement to majors.

111. JOINT MAJORS
a. JOINT MAJOR IN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: This major consists of twelve hours of English
Composition beyond Composition 101, and eighteen hours of English
Literature. A student may elect further work in either Literature or
Composition, or both, or in some related subject, as part of the forty-
two hours in her field of concentration.
The courses in Composition should include six hours of grade II
and six hours of grade III. Students exempted from Composition
101 at midyears should complete the year with a Composition course of

nation of questions selected from the general examinations set for
English Literature and English Composition. The questions will deal
with the material in both fields included in the student's program for
the joint major.
b. JOINT MAJOR WITH EMPHASIS ON DRAMA
Distribution of work: This major consists of eighteen hours of English
Literature, fourteen hours of English Composition beyond 101, and six

supplemented by any semester course of grade II, or by 210); and six
hours of grade III (309).
English Composition: at least six hours of grade II (including 207
taken preferably in the junior year) and eight hours of grade III (303

ing this major should choose another grade II course or a course in
another department in order to take 207, with emphasis on drama, in
the junior year. Course 304 may be devoted mainly to play-writing
by students choosing this major.
Speech: 203, Theatre Workshop.
General examination: Students taking this major will be examined in
the general examination upon thirty hours of work selected from the
courses listed above.
Students who wish may include other courses in drama in the field of
concentration, e.g., French 212, 213, German 308, Greek 203, 301,
Italian 307, 310, Latin 203, Music 323, Spanish 104, 204, 301, Speech

I. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES *
The Department of Hygiene and Physical Education, through its program
adapted to individual needs and abilities, aims to help each student to build up
sufficient strength and vitality to meet the demands of a normally active liſe;
to appreciate and practice fundamental health habits; to develop a normal
carriage, a sense of rhythm, coördination and motor judgment; to be a coöpera-
tive and contributing participant in group activity; and to acquire skill and
a lasting interest in wholesome forms of recreation.
Four hours in Hygiene and Physical Education are prescribed for the degree.
Two hours are met by 120, Personal Hygiene; the other two hours are met by
two periods per week of physical education activities during freshman and
sophomore years. The activity program of each year is divided into three
seasons.
Sports Requirement: During the two years, the department requires that
students take one season of a team sport and two seasons of an individual sport
(not necessarily the same sport). If a student can demonstrate a fair degree of
skill in an individual sport, or if she has a Junior or Senior Life Saving Certifi-
cate, she may substitute other activities for individual sports.
* See Section II, page 105, for opportunities for juniors and seniors to enroll in
professional courses and for information relative to the five-year course in Hygiene
and Physical Education.
104
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
A student's choice of activity is subject to the approval of the department, on
the basis of the results of the medical and physical examinations, the physical
fitness test, and the student's previous experience.
Posture Requirement: Every student is expected to attain a grade of at least C
minus on her posture photograph. Failure to meet this standard at the end of
the second year of indoor work will necessitate enrollment in course 125 until the
standard is attained or until the end of the winter season of the senior year.
The 122 winter grade will be withheld until this requirement is fulfilled.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
A major in Italian is generally based on 101. It is
It is very desirable
that students majoring in Italian should have had or be taking a col-
lege course in one of the ancient or modern languages, and should
elect such courses in history and art as deal in whole or in part with
Italian civilization and culture. Such courses will be required of
students working for honors.
Students taking a twenty-four-hour major should include 102, 201 or
202 or 207, 301, 304, 306, 307 or 308.
Students taking a thirty-hour major should include 102, 201, 202 or
207, 301, 304, 306, 307 or 308.
NOTE:—101 may not count toward the major.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination for students taking a major in Italian will
be based largely on the work done in the courses of grades II and III,
and will be of such a character as to bring out the interrelation of these
courses, bearing in mind that while some appear to be more closely
articulated than others, they all make their contribution to the cultural
development of Italian life. Some of the questions will have a direct
bearing on the content of the courses, while others will be of a more
general character, and will best be answered by opinions expressed
and deductions drawn.
The results of the elementary work will appear in the degree of ac-
curacy and ease of expression shown in the written portion of the
examination, but especially in translating from English into Italian
and vice versa.
* It will be the privilege of students in grade III courses to have access to the
manuscripts and early—often contemporary-editions of Italian authors contained
in the Frances Pearsons Plimpton Collection.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
These courses are designed to provide for the general student a basis
for the interpretation of phenomena in the world of living things. At
the same time they may furnish a foundation for students who plan to
follow professionally some phase of biological work, such as teaching,
research, laboratory technique, medicine, public health, physical educa-
tion, nursing, medical social service.
Five-year Hygiene students wishing to major in the department
should elect 101 in the freshman or sophomore year, and 301, 313, and
302 in the junior and senior years.
Pre-medical students are referred to the requirements as given on
page 36.
For public health work, students are advised to elect 101 or 203, 308
and 303 in this department and to include Botany 308 among the
courses related to the major.
A knowledge of Chemistry is required of all students taking work
in Physiology and is desirable for all students majoring in the depart-
ment. A reading knowledge of French and German is desirable,
though not required.
Students majoring in the department may under certain conditions
obtain permission from the Chemistry department to take Chemistry
301 after having taken 101.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination will test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles underlying animal life, the essential facts in-
volved, and their significance. It will also test her ability to correlate
the subject matter of the courses included in her major.
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
Wellesley is a residential college. The conditions of life at Wellesley
are designed to facilitate and supplement the scholar's activity.
THE Deans are the officers most directly concerned with the organi-
zation of the academic community. In addition to the Dean of In-
struction, the Dean of Students, and the Dean of Residence, there is a
dean for each class. The Dean of Freshmen is ex officio chairman of the
Board of Admission and is, therefore, in a favored position to help en-
tering students take their places in the life of the College. At the be-
ginning of the sophomore year, each class is assigned to a member of the
teaching staff who is relieved from some duties in order to assume re-
sponsibility as the academic adviser for the class during its last three
undergraduate years. The Dean of Students is chairman of the class
deans and is especially responsible for the interpretation of educational
policy to the students. The Dean of Instruction is in charge of those
matters of educational policy and administration which relate es-
pecially to the faculty.
HALLS OF RESIDENCE are maintained for all undergraduates except
those within commuting distance who prefer to live at home. A Head
of House presides over each residence and cooperates with the student
officers to develop the house group as a congenial social unit. Most
of the campus halls have resident faculty members, and other members
of the faculty are frequently entertained in the houses by students.
There are nine freshman houses. Seven of these are in the village, not
far from the campus, and accommodate approximately half the entering
class. Each freshman house has a freshman chairman with a junior as
her adviser. In each of the other campus houses, members of at least
three classes are in residence. Rooms are assigned to new students in
the order in which their original application fees have been received.
RELIGIOUS SERVICES are held daily in the College Chapel. On week
days these are conducted by some member of the faculty, except on
Thursday when a member of the senior class is the leader. The Sun-
day morning services are led by visiting clergymen of many denomina-
tions. In all these services the college choir, led by a member of the
department of Music, participates; and, in addition, there are a number
of special musical vesper services during the year. The Christian
Association conducts a varied program of religious discussions and
conferences, and its officers direct numerous service agencies in the
neighborhood of Wellesley in which many students participate. The
Christian Association coöperates with the student Christian Movement
and is an important link between Wellesley students and those of other
colleges in this country and abroad.
THE HEALTH SERVICE is directed by the college physicians in coöp-
eration with the department of Hygiene and Physical Education. The
154
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
155
medical staff includes four physicians, one of whom is a psychiatrist.
One of the physicians is available for visits to student houses, and a
clinic is open without charge to all students at Simpson Infirmary,
where seven trained nurses are in constant attendance. The proximity
of the College to Boston permits frequent conference with other doctors,
and early consultation in case of serious illness is assured. Hospitals in
Boston and Newton are so accessible that immediate care can be given
to any type of illness or accident. In case of serious illness, parents are
notified by telephone or telegram. Seven days of infirmary care are
provided without charge to the student.
Emphasis is laid on preventive medicine and on the maintenance of
healthy living conditions on the campus. Campus employees are
examined by a college physician, and the doctors coöperate with the
dietitian and purveyor in the selection of food.
THE PLACEMENT OFFICE, established by the Founders of the College
as the Teachers' Registry, includes in its scope the placing of seniors
and alumnae in teaching and other professions, business, government,
and industry; the supplying of information about training courses, ap-
prenticeships, and assistantships; and the arranging of lectures and dis-
cussions on occupations. Registration for placement is open to all who
have taken courses in Wellesley College. Students are invited to register
during their senior year but the office is open for conference and advice
to all students. The office maintains files, collects credentials, and is
the source of information concerning the vocational equipment and
experience of Wellesley women. The registration fee is two dollars for
life membership, and no commission is charged for placement. The
office also registers undergraduates and alumnae for summer work, and
has charge of undergraduate employment.
The staff of the Placement Office consists of a Director, two Appoint-
ment Secretaries and three assistants. This staff is in active coöpera-
tion with other administrative offices.
THE COLLEGE GOVERNMENT AssoCIATION is responsible for the main-
tenance of efficient organization of the undergraduate community. It
is directed largely by students, though it receives its charter from the
Academic Council of the Faculty, which has representatives on its
governing boards. Other student organizations foster a variety of in-
terests: the Athletic Association; the Barnswallows (dramatic) Associa-
tion; the Christian Association; the Forum; the Cosmopolitan Club; the
Poetry Club; and numerous departmental clubs. The Wellesley
College Service Fund is administered by a special committee of faculty
and students which raises and distributes funds for educational and
philanthropic agencies. The largest item in its budget is the annual
contribution to Yenching University in China.
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
(Listed in order of construction)
College Hall, the first academic building of Wellesley College, was
the gift of the founders, Mr. and Mrs Henry Fowle Durant. In 1875
it was finished and equipped under the close personal supervision of the
founders. On March 17, 1914, all but onc wing of this historic building
was destroyed by fire. That wing, in constant use since 1914, was re-
modeled in 1936 and houses the department of Geology and Geogra-
phy. It is located on the hill overlooking Lake Waban.
Music Hall and BILLINGS HALL are large brick buildings devoted
to the department of Music Music Hall, built in 1880, contains
offices, practice studios, and listening rooms, and includes in its equip-
ment thirty-seven pianos, six victrolas, a recording machine, and a two-
manual organ. The ground floor of Billings Hall (opened in 1904) is
given over to the department offices, two classrooms, and a small audi-
torium. These are equipped with six pianos, a clavichord, a three-
manual organ, two specially built phonographs of rare fidelity in
reproduction, and apparatus for the projection of music on a large il-
luminated screen. The second floor is occupied by the Music Library
and the office of the Research Librarian in Music.
The Music Library contains 4,700 scores, 2,550 reference books on
musical subjects, and 2,700 victrola records, and includes as well a
collection of musical manuscripts which is part of the Hazard Collec-
tion now housed in the treasure room of the main library.
The department has at its disposal the assignment to students of eight
tickets for the weekly concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
Symphony Hall, Boston.
SIMPSON INFIRMARY, a brick building erected in 1881, was used as a
residence hall until 1908. It now provides living quarters for the Resi-
dent Physician and the infirmary staff.
Adjoining this building is a thoroughly modern hospital unit com-
pleted in February, 1942. Besides the doctors' offices and well-
equipped clinic, there are twenty-three patients' bedrooms, lounges,
a solarium, and X-ray and physiotherapy laboratories.
THE FARNSWORTH ART BUILDING was the gift of the late Isaac D.
Farnsworth in 1889. It contains lecture rooms and exhibition galleries
and is used by the department of Art for its library, study rooms,
laboratories and studios.
Through the active interest of friends of the College, the Museum
contains a small but representative selection of monuments from differ-
ent periods and styles: Egyptian minor arts; the M. Day Kimball collec-
tion of classical sculpture, including a Polyklitan figure of an athlete;
Græco-Buddhist stucco sculpture from Kashmir; a recently excavated
156
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
157
mosaic from Antioch; a few Italian primitives; a 16th century tapestry;
the James J. Jarves collection of textiles and laces; a polychrome terra-
cotta bust of the Virgin attributed to Silvestro dell'Aquila; a bronze by
Kolbe; an early Corot; a late Renoir; a small painting by Francesco
Furini; the Cumæan Sibyl by Elihu Vedder; two paintings by Frank
Duveneck; a portrait study by Whistler; and two miniatures by Artemis
Tavshanjian.
THE CHAPEL was presented in 1899 by Miss Elizabeth G. Houghton
and Mr. Clement S. Houghton as a memorial to their father, Mr.
William S. Houghton, a trustee of the College from 1880 to his death in
1894. Its windows include memorials to the Founder of the College
and to various alumnae and members of the faculty. Behind the me-
morial tablet (by Daniel Chester French) in honor of Alice Freeman
Palmer are the urns holding her ashes and those of her husband, Pro-
fessor George Herbert Palmer, trustee of Wellesley College from 1912
to 1933. The three-manual, Aeolian-Skinner organ of ninety-one
stops was dedicated in the fall of 1936.
THE WHITIN OBSERVATORY is a one-story building of brick, faced
with white marble, situated on a small hill on the college grounds and
devoted entirely to the use of the department of Astronomy. THE OB-
SERVATORY HOUSE, the residence of the Director of the Observatory, is
nearby. The Observatory, the House, and much of the astronomical
equipment are gifts of the late Mrs. John C. Whitin.
MARY HEMENWAY Hall, on the western border of the campus, was
erected in 1909 as headquarters of the department of Hygiene and
Physical Education when the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics
became a part of Wellesley College. It contains lecture rooms, labora-
tories, offices, and the library of the department of Hygiene and Physi-
cal Education.
THE LIBRARY of the College, endowed by Eben Norton Horsford,
now numbers over 226,000 bound volumes, including the departmental
libraries. The building of the Main Library was the gift of Andrew
Carnegie. It was opened for use in 1910 and was enlarged to its
present size in 1916, with seating capacity for 539 readers. The books
in the Main Library form a collection chosen primarily for the use of
students and instructors in Literature and Languages, the Social Sci-
ences, Philosophy, Mathematics, Biblical History, and Geography.
The Library is catalogued by author and subject entries, and the most
recent and useful bibliographical aids are provided. Special effort
is made to train students in methods of research.
The Library subscribe for more than one thousand American and
foreign periodicals, including daily newspapers representing different
sections of the United States, besides representative British and Con-
tinental dailies.
The Library has also many special collections of great interest and
value to the student doing graduate or other research work. Among
158
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
the most valuable of these are the Frances Pearsons Plimpton Collec-
tion of Italian books and manuscripts chiefly of the Renaissance; the
Ruskin Collection; the English Poetry Collection; the Katharine Lee
Bates Collection of Modern Poets; the Laura Hibbard Loomis Collec-
tion of Medieval Literature. With the establishment of the Mayling
Soong Foundation, it is expected that a model undergraduate book
collection will develop for teaching the art, culture, history, and philos-
ophy of the Far East, particularly China.
The Brooks Memorial Room provides comfortable and beautiful
surroundings with carefully selected books for leisure hours of reading.
The following departmental libraries are located in the buildings of
the respective departments: Art, Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Edu-
cation, Geology, Hygiene, Music, Physics, Psychology, and Zoology.
THE PAGE MEMORIAL SCHOOL on the college campus has two small
buildings and is devoted to the education of young children.
FOUNDERS HALL, a building for lecture rooms and department offices
pertaining to instruction in the liberal arts, was opened for use in 1919.
The hall was built from the Restoration Fund, secured for the College
through trustees, faculty, alumnae, and other friends, and replaces in
some part College Hall, the first and main building of the College. The
building is dedicated as a memorial to the Founders of the College.
ALUMNAE Hall, built in 1923 as the gift of the alumnae for a recrea-
tion center, contains an auditorium seating 1,570, a ballroom, a library,
committee rooms for the use of alumnae and students, and full equip-
ment for entertaining. There is also a recreation room, known as "The
Well”, which contains a soda fountain, tables for light refreshments,
and a nickelodeon.
SAGE HALL was built to house the departments of Botany and Zool-
ogy and Physiology. The first unit for the department of Botany was
erected in 1927, and the Zoology and Physiology unit in 1931. The
principal donor was Mrs. Russell Sage.
HETTY H. R. Green Hall, the administration building, was in large
part the gift of Mrs. Green's son and daughter, Colonel Edward H. R.
Green and Mrs. Matthew A. Wilks. It contains the administrative
offices, class and seminar rooms, the faculty assembly hall, and offices of
student organizations. The Galen L. Stone Tower, named for its
donor, contains a carillon which was the gift of Mrs. Charlotte Nichols
Greene.
PENDLETON HALL was opened in 1935. It was named at the request
of the undergraduates in honor of Ellen Fitz Pendleton, President
of the College from 1911 to 1936. This fire-proof building houses the
departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology.
The RecREATION BUILDING, containing the George HowE DAVEN-
PORT SWIMMING POOL, was opened in March, 1939. It is the gift of
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
159
many donors, two of whom, Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, gave large sums.
Students and alumnae gave generously to increase the "Swimming Pool
Fund” which accumulated for nearly thirty years. This building has
many facilities, including squash and badminton courts, and is used for
the indoor activities of the physical cducation classes. It also serves
as a recreation center for students, faculty, administration, alumnae,
and their guests.

SCHOLARSHIPS
Scholarships maintained by income froin perinanent funds are
awarded annually to undergraduate students, and grants are made
from other funds which the trustees set aside for this purpose
each
year.
The students who qualify for these scholarships are, in the main, those
who have been in Wellesley College at least a year, but some freshmen
and a few students who transfer from other institutions receive grants.
Awards are made in recognition of intellectual ability, of good college
citizenship and character, and of genuine financial need. The size of
the scholarships ranges in general from $100 to $500.
Applications from students in college must be filed with the Dean of
Students, who is Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Scholarships,
on forms furnished for the purpose and in accordance with the instruc-
tions posted near the close of the first semester.
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR FRESHMEN:
A limited number of scholarships are offered to incoming freshmen.
Awards are based on financial need and on credentials which give
promise of academic success and good college citizenship. There are
fifteen Pendelton Scholarships of $600. As funds permit, sums rang-
ing from $100 to $400 are awarded to other freshman applicants.
Applications from all candidates for admission should be made to the
Dean of Freshmen before March 15 of the year of admission. More
detailed information about scholarships may be obtained by writing
directly to the Dean of Freshmen.
Wellesley College is a member of the Seven College Conference
which has established National Honor Scholarships for Women. These
scholarships may be competed for by students from the three following
districts: Middle West, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; South, Louisiana,
New Mexico, Texas; West, California, Oregon, Washington. Infor-
mation about these scholarships may be obtained by writing to Mrs. F.
Murray Forbes, Jr., Executive Secretary, Committee on National
Scholarships for Women, 21 Beaver Place, Boston 8, Massachusetts.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT:
The Placement Office offers assistance to students who wish to earn
money toward their college expenses. The types of employment are
mainly caring for children, clerical work, tutoring, library work, assist-
ing in the various offices of the College, and some domestic work.
While the Placement Office makes every effort to obtain places for
those who wish to work, it cautions students against depending upon
this source for any considerable income. Such employment makes a
distinct draft upon strength and time, and it is hardly to be advised for
the freshman year.

SCHOLARSHIPS
THE WELLESLEY STUDENTS' Aid SOCIETY:
This organization is maintained by alumnae and former students of
the College, aided by the faculty and undergraduates, as their contribu-
tion towards keeping the opportunity of Wellesley open to students of
moderate means. Awards are made both in gifts and in loans, and
usually in some combination of the two. These awards are made on
practically the same basis as the college scholarships and supplement
them for necessary college expenses. They ordinarily range from $50
to $200. Loans and occasionally gifts in small sums, $5 to $25, are also
made for incidental expenses and emergencies.

The object of the School is to furnish an opportunity to study in Greece
the literature, art, antiquities, and history of the country under suitable
guidance; to prosecute and to aid original research in these subjects;
and to assist in the exploration and excavation of classic sites. Three
fellowships of $1,200 each are awarded annually on the basis of com-
petitive examinations and are open to graduates of the coöperating
colleges of which Wellesley College is one. For further information
apply to Associate Professor McCarthy.
The American School of Classical Studies in Rome is an integral part of the
American Academy in Rome. The object of this School is to promote
the study of classical literature in its bearing upon antiquities and his-
tory; of classical, Etruscan, and Italian art and archæology, including
topography, palæography, and epigraphy, and of the art and archæol-
ogy of the early Christian, Mediæval, and Renaissance periods within
the boundaries of Italy. Those admitted are expected to put them-
selves under the guidance of the director of the Academy and the pro-
fessor in charge of the School for the full period of eight months. Duly
qualified graduates of Wellesley College are exempt from any charge
for tuition. Three fellowships in the school of Classical Studies are

HISTORICAL SKETCH
Withe
ELLESLEY COLLEGE is one of that group of women's colleges estab-
lished in the nineteenth century to offer to young women the edu-
cational opportunities “equivalent to those usually provided in colleges
for young men.” The motive of its founder, Henry Fowle Durant, was,
however, something more than the enrichment of the experience of
young women for their own sake. Addressing the first students in the
fall of 1875 he said, “You mistake altogether the significance of the
movement of which you are a part if you think this is simply a question
of a college education for girls. I believe that God's hand is in it; ...
that He is calling to womanhood to come up higher, to prepare herself
for great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life, for noblest usefulness."
To the end of preparing women for positions of responsibility, Mr.
Durant insisted from the beginning on the maintenance of high aca-
demic standards, and of healthy community life in beautiful surround-
ings. He built an impressive College Hall on his own spacious estate
twelve miles west of Boston, and spared no pains to make his gift con-
tribute to the aesthetic development of students. He began to beautify
the four hundred acre campus which has become one of Wellesley's dis-
tinctive assets. He encouraged the inclusion in the student body of rep-
resentatives from all parts of the country and from foreign lands. He
placed more emphasis on personal quality than on the accident of eco-
nomic status, and he maintained a real democracy within the college
family. He opened unusual professional opportunities to women on
the faculty. He introduced laboratory work in science before it was
widely recognized as academically necessary. He recognized the sig-
nificance of the arts in education and encouraged "learning by doing.”
He assumed that religion was a normal part of the life of educated peo-
ple and made provision for its study and expression in the program of
the new community.
From the beginning the Board of Trustees has been composed of men
and women whose interests have been far-reaching in New England and
around the world. The first board included the President of Yale Col-
lege, Chancellor of the University of the City of New York, Dean of the
Episcopal Theological School at Cambridge, President of Boston
University, a professor of the Rochester Theological Seminary and of
Andover Theological Seminary, two pastors, and a former Governor
of Massachusetts. The roster has been continuously noteworthy for the
calibre of the persons who have contributed of their time, their profes-
sional experience, their money to strengthen the College. The present
board includes educators as well as financiers, lawyers, an architect,
a doctor, businessmen-men and women of wide cultural interests se-
lected for their expert contribution. It is a working board. Three of
its regular members are nominated by vote of the Alumnae Association.
22
HISTORICAL SKETCH
23
An unusual feature of organization is the membership of a “faculty
trustee” who is not a member of the faculty but is nominated by the Aca-
demic Council.
The history of the College falls into two fairly distinct periods, before
and after the College Hall Fire. The College was chartered on March
17, 1870, but the planning of the program and the construction of Col-
lege Hall required five years of effort and the opening did not occur until
September, 1875. In a surprisingly short period, under the leadership
of President Ada Howard (1875-1881) and Alice Freeman (1881-1887),
the institution became established as a well-known college. It bor-
rowed ideas and methods from various institutions, notably Mount
Holyoke Seminary's program of domestic work for each student. It
drew heavily on the resources of Harvard University but at once as-
sumed responsibility for copying nothing blindly and for introducing a
type of instruction which gave scope to the initiative of students.
During the presidencies of Helen Shafer (1887–1894) and Julia Irvine
(1894–1899) the present curriculum of the College took shape and the
experimental venture in higher education for women became estab-
lished as a permanent part of the educational scene. President Caro-
line Hazard (1899–1910) brought to the academically mature College
the graciousness of the artist. Music, art, gracious living were re-
emphasized as important factors in a community of educated people.
On the night of March 17, 1914, College Hall burned to the ground.
The orderly evacuation of the building with no injury to any occupant
won world-wide fame for the already well-known College. In the
emergency created by this catastrophe President Ellen Fitz Pendleton
(1911–1936) came to the position of leadership which made her indeed
the builder which she will always be in the grateful memory of Welles-
ley women. Within twenty-five years the College grew from an in-
adequately housed, financially handicapped institution to a beautifully
equipped and well-endowed college. More significantly, Miss Pendle-
ton guided the reorganization of the faculty into a democratically con-
trolled policy-making body which worked consistently to maintain and
develop a vital curriculum and community life. She assisted in the for-
mation of a vigorous Alumnae Association and presided over the mag-
nificent efforts of the trustees and alumnae to raise enough money to
rebuild, expand, and endow the College.
During the very years of Wellesley's urgent need, the efforts of all
its members were directed to the war service of four overseas units.
Wellesley is no "ivory tower” to which people withdraw from contact
with world needs. Her fifteen thousand alumnae, engaged in every
kind of responsible task, prove that fact. The register of graduates lists
Wellesley women living in each state of the United States and in fifty-
one foreign lands.
Wellesley College started with three hundred students, most of them
in a preparatory department which was part of the College until 1879.
It has become a college for fifteen hundred students, with fifty or sixty
24
HISTORICAL SKETCH
graduate students. Commensurate with this growth, the external as-
pects of the College have changed almost completely. Starting with
one building, it now has forty-seven. It began with Mr. Durant's
private library of 8,000 volumes; its present library numbers over
230,000 volumes. Its one gymnasium room has been replaced by two
large buildings to provide instructional and recreational facilities for
the graduate department of Hygiene and Physical Education and for
the enlarged undergraduate group.
With the coming of war in December, 1941, faculty and students alike
turned their attention toward preparing the College for its part in the
war effort. Changes were made in the lighting of buildings and grounds
to conform to the dimout regulations of this region, and a college organi-
zation for air-raid protection was developed in close coöperation with
the Town of Wellesley. The students modified their extracurricular
activities to free time for various kinds of community or war service.
Also, a faculty-student committee was organized to encourage students
to use vacations for this purpose. Students have met the shortage of
employees by doing domestic work in the houses coöperatively. From
October, 1943, to September, 1944, a branch of the Navy Supply
Corps School located at Harvard University was housed in Cazenove
and Pomeroy Halls.
In the midst of these changes in the daily routine and in the external
aspects of college life, members of the faculty and administration have
made every effort to safeguard the integrity of the academic work of
the College and to play their part in maintaining the intellectual
disciplines underlying our civilization.
ADMISSION
ADAMUS
DMISSION to Wellesley College is competitive. From the group
of candidates, the Board of Admission selects those who give
the best evidence of possessing intellectual interest and ability and the
qualities of character and personality necessary for college citizenship.
There is a definite limit on the number of students who can be admitted
in any year since the College has facilities for only fifteen hundred
students.
APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION
All communications concerning admission should be addressed to the
Board of Admission, Wellesley College, Wellesley 81, Massachusetts.
Forms for application will be furnished on request. An application
fee of ten dollars is required of all applicants and no registration is re-
corded until the fee is received. If the candidate cancels her registra-
tion or does not enter the College for any reason, the fee is not refunded,
but it may be transferred to apply to a later year if the request for the
transfer is received within a reasonable time after the beginning of the
year for which the candidate is registered to enter college.
A report from the applicant's physician showing that she is organically
sound and in good health, together with a certificate of vaccination and
any required tests, must be filed with the Board of Admission well in
advance of the date of entrance. The College reserves the right to re-
ject any candidate who, in the opinion of the college physicians, is not
fitted for work in the college community, and to dismiss at any time a
student who does not coöperate fully with the college health officers.
ADMISSION TO THE FRESHMAN CLASS
Application for admission to the freshman class may be made to the
Chairman of the Board of Admission at any tiine up to March 1 of the
year
of entrance. A student is advised to make application not later
than the beginning of her junior year in secondary school so that her
school program may be approved before it is too late to make schedule
changes. Since rooms are assigned according to the date of application,
there is an added advantage in early registration. The date of applica-
tion is not, however, a factor in determining admission.
In selecting the freshman class, the Board of Admission reviews
school records, recommendations, information from the candidate
concerning her interests and plans of study, and the results of the
Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Tests. From a large number of
applicants a class of about four hundred is chosen. Candidates will
receive notification of the results of their applications late in May.
25
26
ADMISSION
Students who are interested in admission should read carefully the
recommendations concerning secondary school subjects to be offered for
entrance and the statement concerning the required College Board tests.
ADMISSION SUBJECTS
For admission to Wellesley College 16 units * of secondary school
work are required. These units should be distributed mainly in the
fields of English, foreign language, mathematics, history, and science.
The courses listed below are recommended as providing a generally
satisfactory basis for work at Wellesley College:
English. .
4 units
Foreign Languages.
5 units
It is recommended that these 5 units be divided as follows: Latin
or Greek, 3 units; a modern language (French, German, Spanish,
or Italian), 2 units. Candidates who have other language pro-
grams are asked to write to the Board of Admission for approval
of their courses before applying for admission. No credit will be
given for one unit of a foreign language.
Mathematics
3 units
These units are to consist of Algebra, 2 units, and Plane Geom-
etry, 1. When only two units of mathematics are offered for
entrance, one must be in Algebra, the other in Geometry.
History .
1 unit
This is the minimum requirement. The unit may be in any
branch of history. European History is especially recommended
for students interested primarily in languages, literature, and the
arts.
Science .
1 unit
This unit may be in Biology, Physics, or Chemistry. General
Science may be counted as one of the free elective units.
Elective subjects
2 units
Additional units in any of the subjects listed above may be in-
cluded, or courses in Art, Biblical History, and Social Studies such
as Civics, Problems of Democracy, Economics, and Sociology.
Music may be offered for one, two, or three units as follows:
one unit, fundamentals of music; two units, fundamentals of
music and literature of music, or fundamentals and practical
music (literature of music and practical music may not be offered
except with fundamentals); three units, fundamentals of music,
literature of music, and practical music.
Students who are unable to take some of the recommended subjects
or who have been advised by their schools to substitute a unit in one
subject for a unit in another are invited to submit their programs to the
Board of Admission for approval. In considering an individual pro-
A unit represents one year's study in any one subject, constituting approxi-
mately a quarter of a full year's work,
*
ADMISSION
27
gram, the College takes into account as far as possible the interests of the
student and the sclection of courses offered by her school.
The Board of Admission welcomes information concerning unusual
curricular plans or new courses which secondary schools are recom-
mending to their students.
School RECORDS
Complete records of a student's work in secondary school are re-
quired. Blanks for the preliminary records are sent to school prin-
cipals a year in advance of the student's completion of preparatory
work. Blanks for supplementary reports are sent during the year of
final preparation for college.
The school record must be supplemented by statements from the
school principal concerning the special abilities and interests of the
student, power of sustained work, good health habits, integrity, sense of
responsibility, initiative and self-reliance in work and in social action.
The College wishes to be informed of circumstances which may have
furthered or interfered with a student's work and of special honors and
accomplishments during the student's secondary school course.
TESTS FOR ADMISSION
All candidates for entrance to the freshman class are required to take
the Scholastic Aptitude Test and three achievement tests given by
the College Entrance Examination Board. Application for these tests
must be made directly to the College Board in Princeton, New Jersey,
by the candidate herself. The dates for making application and the
address of the Board are given below.
The Scholastic Aptitude Test, which includes both verbal and mathe-
matical sections, is designed to test a student's general aptitude for col-
lege work. No special preparation for it is necessary. It is recom-
mended that this test be taken by a candidate in June of her junior
year in secondary school whenever this is possible.
Achievement tests are given in English Composition, Social Studies,
four foreign languages, and three sciences. (See page 28 for the com-
plete list of tests. Candidates for admission
Candidates for admission to Wellesley are required
to take the English test and two others chosen from different fields.
These tests should be taken in 1946 on April 6 so that the Wellesley
Board of Admission will have the results when it meets in May to select
the freshman class. The Scholastic Aptitude Test may also be taken at
this time if it has not been taken earlier.
Attention is called to the fact that the achievement tests are designed
to be taken in stride without extensive review or extra study and without
any speeding up of the school program. The result of each test is
judged in relation to the number of years a candidate has spent studying
the subject.
In addition to taking the Scholastic Aptitude and achievement tests,
28
ADMISSION
candidates from New York State may submit for admission their grades
on the Regents' examinations. Candidates from foreign countries are
expected to take the College Entrance Examination Board tests if it is
possible for them to make arrangements to do so.

ADMISSION
ADMISSION TO ADVANCED STANDING
If a student has maintained an excellent record in a recognized col-
lege and has special interests which she can follow at Wellesley Col.
lege, she may apply for admission to the sophomore or the junior class.
The number of students who can be admitted with advanced standing
in any year, however, is very small, and only students with unusually
strong records are encouraged to apply.
A candidate must have completed the secondary school courses rec-
ommended for admission to the freshman class (see page 26) and at least
a full year of work at another college. She should be entitled to honor-
able dismissal from the college which she has attended and should be
recommended by her instructors and dean. A transcript of the stu-
dent's college record for at least one semester should accompany her
letter requesting application forms.
All candidates for admission to advanced standing are required to
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test of the College Entrance Examination
Board. Applicants who have taken this test should request the College
Board to send the results to Wellesley College. Those who have not
taken it should plan to do so as soon as possible. Information con-
cerning application for the test is given on page 27 of this Catalogue.
Other aptitude tests are not acceptable as substitutes.
A student must be in residence at least two years at Wellesley College
to obtain the B.A. degree, one of which must be the senior year. The
work of these two years must include all the prescribed work (see page
33) not covered by the credentials submitted and such courses as are
needed to meet the requirements for distribution and concentration
(see page 33). Credit for courses completed at another college is
tentatively granted early in the first year of residence. The final
determination of credit is not made until the end of the year since the
success of advanced standing candidates in courses at Wellesley is an
important consideration in deciding upon credit.
The selection of students for admission with advanced standing
will be made in July of the year in which entrance is desired.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE M.A. AND M.S.
DEGREES
Candidates for the degree of Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Educa-
tion, or Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education must
hold the Bachelor's degree from a college of satisfactory standing, and
must present adequate credentials signifying their ability to carry on
the work for the degree.
Application for admission as a graduate student in any department
should be made upon forms which will be furnished by the Dean of
Graduate Students on request. It is desirable that the application be
sent by March first of the year in which the student proposes to enter.
It should be accompanied (1) by the official record of courses and
ADMISSION
31
grades, (2) by a copy of the catalogue of the institution attended,
marked to indicate the courses taken.
Graduate scholarships are described on page 167.
For requirements for the M.A. and M.S. degrees see page 36. A cir-
cular containing full information for graduate students will be sent on
application to the Dean of Graduate Students.
ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE TEACHING CERTIFICATE IN
HYGIENE AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION
A two years' course, especially designed for the training of teachers

DEGREES
The following degrees are conferred by the Trustees upon recom-
mendation of the Academic Council:
Bachelor of Arts.
Master of Arts.
Master of Arts in Education.
Master of Science in Hygiene and Physical Education.
Certificate in Hygiene and Physical Education.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.A. DEGREE
In constructing the curriculum of which the requirements are given below,
the faculty was guided by a belief that a student's four years in college should
give her several specific sorts of training. The prescribed work is planned to
assure her possession of certain skills which are of general use, and to add to
the information which she has acquired before coming to college further in-
formation considered of fundamental importance. Thus the prescribed work
in English Composition and Speech is designed to assure her having accuracy
and effectiveness in speaking and writing English. The prescription in Hy-
giene affords the student a knowledge of the laws of health. The prescribed
work in Biblical History gives a knowledge of the historical basis of Christianity.
The requirement of work for distribution is made with the purpose of securing
for each student some acquaintance with methods of work and ways of thinking
in various representative fields of knowledge. The requirement of work for con-
centration is made in order that the student shall make a reasonably thorough
study of one field of knowledge. The curriculum is so planned that a student
has the opportunity to elect without restriction a number of courses to suit her
individual need and interest.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must complete before graduation
the equivalent of one hundred and twenty semester hours, and have
in addition a reading knowledge of one of the following: French, Ger-
man, Greek, Italian, Latin, Spanish.
The test of the reading knowledge of one of these foreign languages
consists in the attainment of a sufficiently high score in the College
Entrance Examination Board Achievement Test in French, German,
Latin, or Spanish, or in the exainination given by Wellesley College in
Greek or Italian. Students may gain exemption from further tests by
obtaining a good rating in the College Board test submitted for ad-
mission. In general the choice of the language to be offered is left to
the student, but any department offering work for a major may require
its major students to pass the examination in one particular language or
in one of any two or more specified languages. Students majoring
in a foreign language will be tested in a reading knowledge of a second
language; in this case students may postpone the examination until the
beginning of the senior year.

Of the required subjects, English Composition, six hours, must be taken in
the freshman year; Hygiene and Physical Education, three hours in the fresh-
man year, and one hour in the sophomore year; Biblical History, six hours,
in the sophomore year; Speech, two hours, before the junior year.
II. WORK FOR DISTRIBUTION. Twelve hours in addition to the pre-
scribed work, to be elected in each of the three groups given below.
The twelve hours in each of the three groups are to be elected so as to fall
six hours in one department and six hours in one or two other depart-
ments. Only one beginning course in a modern language may be
counted for distribution.
Group I. Art, English Composition, English Literature, French, Ger-
man, Greek, Italian, Latin, Music, Russian, Spanish, Speech.
Group II. Biblical History, Economics, Education, History, Philosophy,
Political Science, Psychology, Sociology.
Group III. Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Geology and Geography,
Mathematics, Physics, Zoology and Physiology.
Every freshman must take for distribution six hours in each of two groups;
and every student is required to have had by the end of her sophomore year at
least six hours counting for distribution in each group.
III. WORK FOR CONCENTRATION. Forty-two semester hours in one
field of concentration, of which a major of twenty-four to thirty hours
shall be in one department, and eighteen to twelve hours shall be in
courses related or supplementary to the major but falling in one or more
departments other than that in which the major is taken. I
All courses are classified in grades I, II, III; grade I indicating ele-
mentary courses and grade III the most advanced courses. Of the
courses offered to fulfill the requirement of work for concentration at least

DEGREES
two hours required at least eighteen hours must be above grade I and
at least twelve hours must be of grade III.
Every candidate for the B.A. degree must pass a general examination in a
major subject in addition to the regular course examinations.
COURSE EXAMINATIONS
An examination period occurs at the end of each semester. Exami-
nations for the removal of conditions and deficiencies and for advanced
standing may be taken during any examination period and at other
specified times.
A student who wishes to take an examination upon a course which is
not a part of her approved schedule for the year must apply to the
College Recorder for the requisite card of admission to the examination.
STANDARD FOR GRADUATION
A certain quality grade is required for graduation and, for the pur-
pose of determining this quality grade, numerical values called "points"
are given to the grade letters as follows: for grade A, eight points for
each semester hour of the course in which the grade is received, A-minus
seven points, B-plus six points, and so on to C-minus one point; for
grade D (passing), no points; for a grade below D, no points and not
counted in hours toward a degree. In order to be recommended for
the degree of Bachelor of Arts a student must in each semester attain a
credit ratio of 1.75. (The credit ratio is the ratio of the number of
quality points earned to the semester hours carried.) Deficiency of
points in any semester may be made good only in accordance with
regulations adopted by the faculty. In general, students who are de-
ficient in quality points at the end of the third year or who are otherwise
not of diploma-grade standing will not be permitted to continue.
The College reserves the right to require the withdrawal of students
whose academic standing is not satisfactory, and of those who for any
other reason have shown themselves to be not in accord with the ideals
and standards which the College seeks to maintain.
HONORS IN A SPECIAL FIELD
Recognition of the desire of certain students to carry on consecutive
and somewhat intensive work along the line of their particular interests
has led to the introduction of a plan for Honors in a Special Field.
A student electing to study for Honors will choose a Field of Special
Study and will work in that field under the direction of one or more of
the instructors concerned who will advise her on the possible develop-
ment of her field and will guide her in the carrying on of independent
work within it.
Students who wish to become candidates for Honors may apply in
the spring of their sophomore or junior year to the committee appointed
to consider these applications.
DEGREES

DEPARTMENTAL HONORS
A plan for Departmental Honors has been established to enable cer-
tain students to enrich the work of the major subject by engaging in a
program of supplementary directed work in the senior year. A can-
didate for Departmental Honors will carry a normal senior program
supplemented by work in the major subject done under the special di-
rection of one or more instructors. The supplementary work will be
planned to suit the needs and interests of the individual student.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELECTING COURSES
The program in the freshman year is as follows:
English Composition 101.
6 hours
Hygiene 120.
2 hours
Hygiene 121 (practical work 2 hours)
1 hour
Electives, 4 six-hour courses
24 hours
Total
33 hours
The courses must be chosen in accordance with the prerequisites
given in the department statements from the list of courses named be-
low, with the provision that one course must be chosen from each of two
of the three groups described below. It is unwise to include two begin-
ning courses in modern language.

not be necessary. Students are held responsible for observing the
requirements for the degree and the proper sequence of courses.
PRE-PROFESSIONAL COURSES
Students who plan to apply for admission to professional schools after
leaving Wellesley College should consult their class deans about appro-
priate electives early in the course.
Each student who is planning to study medicine is advised to confer
with her class dean before the beginning of her sophomore year. Enter-
ing students are advised to elect two pre-medical sciences in the fresh-
man year. In general, requirements for admission to medical schools
of Class A can be met by eighteen hours in Chemistry and twelve hours
in Physics and Zoology respectively, but each student is advised to study
carefully the requirements for the particular school which she has
chosen. Attention is called to the fact that twenty-four hours are re-
quired as a basis for the general examination in any department. It is,
however, possible to fulfill the minimum requirement for medical
schools, and to take the general examination in an entirely different
field.
Students planning to prepare for work in hospital or public health
laboratories should begin both Chemistry and Zoology in their freshman
year in order to have the necessary foundation for advanced courses.
The departments of Botany, Chemistry, Physics, and Zoology should
be consulted concerning combinations of courses in later years of the
college course.
PREPARATION FOR TEACHING
A student wishing special preparation for teaching may plan a five
year integrated course leading to a Bachelor of Arts at the end of the
fourth year and a Master of Arts in Education at the end of the fifth.
The courses in a student's field of concentration and her free electives
will be chosen to provide preparation in the subjects which she espe-
cially desires to teach. Her program will include also courses in Edu-
cation which will enable her to meet requirements for certification in
many states. Practice teaching will be included in the work of the
fifth year.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.A. AND M.S. DEGREES
Wellesley College offers graduate work leading to the degrees of
Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Science in
Hygiene and Physical Education. The work required of a candidate is
considered to be the equivalent of twenty-four hours of college work.
In general, a candidate is required to work in one department. The
prograin includes no fewer than two full courses of Grade III or their
equivalent, and may include a thesis embodying the results of original
research or reports based on independent work. A candidate for a
DEGREES

Master's degree is required to have a working knowledge of either
French or Gerinan, to be tested by examination at entrance. Individual
departments may require a second language. At least one year of
graduate study is required of all candidates, but more time may be
needed for the completion of the work. One year in residence is re-
quired of all candidates for the Master's degree.
Information regarding requirements for admission, theses, final ex-
aminations, etc., will be found in the Graduate Circular which will be
sent on application to the Dean of Graduate Students.

HISTORY OF ART
Many of the courses in Art include some laboratory work in the one or more
mediums with which the course is concerned. The department believes that
laboratory training has great value in developing observation and understand-
ing of problems of art, and for this reason requires it of majoring students. It
should be stated, however, that no particular natural aptitude is required and
that the work is scaled to the student's ability.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
Courses 101 and 205, followed by grade IIl courses, form the usual
sequence for a major in Art. 102 may be substituted for 101 if supple-
mented by 104. A reading knowledge of French or German is re-
quired of students majoring in Art; under certain circumstances Greek,
Italian, Latin, or Spanish may be substituted by permission of the de-
partment. Students who are planning to do graduate work should
have both French and German.
Students interested in classical archæology are referred to the state-
ment on page 60 in regard to a major in that field.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
All students who desire a general knowledge of astronomy and of
the universe around them as a part of their general education should
elect 101. Those for whom this course is insufficient but who would
avoid technicalities may well continue with 207 or 206.
A major in Astronomy should ordinarily include 101, 207, 208, 300,
301, and 302. This combination of courses demands as prerequisites
twelve hours in Mathematics and nine hours in Physics. Of the six
languages listed for the language reading requirement, the depart-
ment prefers (but does not insist upon) French or German.
Astronomy 301 may be counted toward a major in Physics, and As-
tronomy 302 toward a major in Mathematics.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination in Astronomy will be based upon the com-
bination of courses which the student has taken as a major. A choice
of questions will always be allowed. In addition to the written ques-

THE TEACHING STAFF.
DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
The courses in Botany are intended to present to the general student
a basis for understanding and interpreting the phenomena of the world
of living things and, at the same time, to furnish a foundation for stu-
dents who plan to follow professionally some phase of biological work.
The major in Botany is based on 101 or on two of the following:
202, 203, 204, 206. The grade III courses, while still emphasizing
BOTANY
55
fundamental biological principles, give more specific training in differ-
ent phases of botanical science. A variety of sequences of courses
is available. Any member of the department will be glad to talk with
students concerning the department courses and supplementing courses
that will most nearly fill their needs. Those students who are planning
to continue their botanical work after graduation along lines of teaching,
research, agricultural and experiment station work, in various kinds of
technical laboratory work, landscape gardening, horticulture, or mu-
seum work, etc., will find it advisable to discuss their plans with the
department as early as possible in their course.
For students interested in bacteriology, public health work, or medi-
cal laboratory work, 308 and 312 present the basic viewpoints and
techniques of bacteriology upon which may be added the more tech-
nical training obtainable in graduate or professional schools. Other
courses, such as 304, 306, and 307, in this department, as well as courses
in Chemistry and Zoology, supplement these offerings.
Course 350 is open for independent study or advanced work in any
field in which the student has had a grade III course in the department.
Courses 308 and 312 may form a part of a Botany major that includes
a year of grade III other than, or in addition to, 309–310 or 350.
The department offerings in Landscape Design, 309-310, may form
a part of a Botany major that includes a year of grade III other than, or
in addition to, 308 or 312.
Botany majors may, under certain conditions, obtain permission from
the Chemistry department to take Chemistry 301 after having had
Chemistry 101.
The department will accept a reading knowledge of any of the foreign
languages prescribed by the College to fulfill its requirements, but of
these it considers French, German, or Latin to be of special value.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination aims to test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles and the basic facts of plant science and to de-
termine her ability to correlate and utilize this information.
A sufficient number of questions will be given to provide a choice for
every student, no matter what combination of courses she has elected in
her major.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
Members of the department will be glad to advise students concern-
ing courses which would best prepare for graduate study, for teaching,
for work in industrial or hospital laboratories, for nursing, or for public
health work.
Premedical students are referred to the requirements for pre-profes-
sional training as given on page 36.
The American Chemical Society has established a set of requirements
which it considers essential for the training of chemists, especially for
industrial work. Students wishing to meet the standard of an accredited
chemist as defined by this Society should consult the chemistry depart-
ment.
For any major in chemistry one of the following sequences of courses
is essential: 101, 201, 202, and 301; or 103, 202, and 301. Any other
courses in the department may be added to these to complete the twenty-
four-hour major. Such a major with the related work in the field of
concentration will give an adequate background for admission to gradu-
ate school and to medical schools of grade A.
60
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
It is advisable that all students majoring in chemistry should complete
at least one year of college physics and one year of college mathematics,
and acquire a reading knowledge of French and German before the
senior year. They will be required to pass a reading knowledge exam-
ination in German or French.
Students not majoring in chemistry who intend to use their chemistry
after graduation will be recommended by the department only if they
have completed at least eighteen hours of chemistry.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The aim of the general examination in chemistry will be to test the
student's knowledge of the fundamental principles and important
facts of chemistry, and her ability to correlate and apply this material.
CLASSICAL ARCHÆOLOGY
The departments of Art, Greek, and Latin offer a program of study
constituting a major in Archæology. The purpose of this major is to
correlate the courses in ancient art with those in Greek and Latin lan-
guage and literature, in order to provide opportunity for a more com-
prehensive study and understanding of ancient civilization than is
available within any one of the separate departments. This major will
also serve as a basic preparation for those students contemplating
graduate and field work in archæology.
The work for concentration should normally include forty-eight hours
divided as follows: eighteen hours in Art; either eighteen hours in Greek
and six hours in Latin or eighteen hours in Latin and six in Greek; six
hours in Ancient History (203 or 204). From the courses elected in
Art, Greek, and Latin, thirty hours will be chosen to form the major.
The choice will be made by the student in consultation with the chair-
man in charge of the work in archæology.
All courses in the Greek and Latin departments may be counted in
the field for concentration, except Greek 203, 204, 207, and Latin 104,
105. In the Art department the following courses may be counted:
101, 209, 314, 318, 320. In addition to these, 350 work may be taken
in any one of the three departments concerned. The complete pro-
gram should include six hours of grade III work in Art and six hours of
grade III work in either Greek or Latin.
Some knowledge of geology is useful for field archæology; chemistry
is valuable both for field and museum work.
A reading knowledge of French, German, or Italian is required for
this major.
The work of the Archæology major will be supervised by a joint
committee composed of representatives from the three departments
concerned. Students should have their program approved by the
chairman of this committee who will be Associate Professor Barbara P.
McCarthy for the year 1945–46.
ECONOMICS
61
The general examination will cover the thirty hours of work included
in the major. It will be given in two parts, one on art, the other on
language and literature.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
1. MAJOR IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
Distribution of work: Course 101, six hours of grade II work, and two
courses of grade III, form the usual sequence for the minimum English
Literature major. It is possible to begin a major in the junior year
by entering a grade II course. Concentration on any one period or
type is not advised for majors. Proper distribution should be insured
by conference with the 101 instructor, and with the chairman of the
department in the spring of the sophomore year.
The following courses in English Literature are not counted in the
major: 104, 210, 212, 213.
Related courses: Related courses for concentration may be chosen from
many fields. Knowledge of at least one foreign literature, and ability
to read certain foreign languages, ancient and modern, is of great value
to the student of English Literature. Understanding of the history of
the periods in which the literature is studied is also important. In
English Composition special attention is called to 201, 208, 303; in the
classical departments, to Greek 203, 204, 207, and Latin 105, dealing
with Greek and Latin literature in translation; in Italian, to 103, Intro-
duction to the Study of the Italian Renaissance. The attention of stu-
dents who are interested in the teaching of English is called to Educa-
tion 307, The Teaching of English in the Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH LITERATURE
The examination will consist of questions covering the courses in-
cluded in the English Literature major. In this list there will be a
sufficient number of questions to insure a fair opportunity for choice.
Each student will select the questions dealing with the subjects she has
studied in her own major. The questions will seek to test: (1) The
student's knowledge of authors, works, types in the periods included in
her major; (2) her intelligence and accuracy in correlating her knowl-
edge; (3) her independence of judgment and her literary discrimination.
II. MAJOR IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: English Composition 101, required of all stu-
dents, will not be counted as part of the major in Composition. For
a twenty-four-hour major the following combination is recommended:
two or more semester courses of grade II (see restrictions under indi-
vidual courses); twelve hours of grade III, in which 303 must be in-
cluded. At least six hours above grade I of English Literature must
be included.
Note: No two writing courses may be taken at the same time, but
English Composition 303 and courses in English Literature may be
taken simultaneously with a writing course.
Courses 209 and 312 in
English Literature are counted as courses in Composition, and may be
78
COURSES OF INSTRUCTION
included in a twenty-four-hour major in English Composition together
with six hours of English Literature above grade I. Work in Compo-
sition for the senior year of such a major must be of grade III: 304 or 350
(year); or some combination of 300, 301, 302, 305, 350 (semester).
Related courses: Students intending to teach or to engage in literary
work should include in their program additional courses in English
Literature. Some knowledge of Latin and Greek literature in the
original or in translation is highly important for a teacher of English,
as is a background of history, especially English history. The attention
of students who are interested in the teaching of English is called to
Education 307, The Teaching of English in the Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION
The general examination in English Composition will include ques-
tions on the theory--on the principles of craftsmanship-underlying
the specific courses the student has taken; it will include a study of the
forms of description, narration, and exposition in their general aspects;
a study of differing types of essay, of biography, of criticism; a study of
the historical development of the sentence, of the paragraph, and of the
linguistic elements composing our vocabulary. The student will be
expected to organize her answers clearly and to write with reasonable
fluency and finish. Supplementary reading and detailed instructions
will be given in a department statement to majors.
III. JOINT MAJORS
a. JOINT MAJOR IN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
Distribution of work: This major consists of twelve hours of English
Composition beyond Composition 101, and eighteen hours of English
Literature. A student may elect further work in either Literature or
Composition, or both, or in some related subject, as part of the forty-
two hours in her field of concentration.
The courses in Composition should include six hours of grade II
and six hours of grade III. Students exempted from Composition
101 at midyears should complete the year with a Composition course of
grade II.
The courses in Literature should include at least six hours of grade
II and six hours of grade III. One of the following courses not counted
in the Literature major may count as part of the joint major: 210, 212.
In general, one of the Literature courses elected should deal with a
period earlier than the nineteenth century.
Related courses: The background of related courses to be desired for
this major is the same as that described under the majors in Literature
and Composition.
General examination: This joint examination will consist of a combi-
nation of questions selected from the general examinations set for
English Literature and English Composition. The questions will deal
FRENCH
79
with the material in both fields included in the student's program for
the joint major.
b. JOINT MAJOR WITH EMPHASIS ON DRAMA
Distribution of work: This major consists of eighteen hours of English
Literature, fourteen hours of English Composition beyond 101, and six
hours of Speech. It should ordinarily be made up as follows:
English Literature: 101 or 104; six hours of grade II (221–222 or 212
supplemented by any semester course of grade II, or by 210); and six
hours of grade III (309).
English Composition: at least six hours of grade II (including 207
taken preferably in the junior year) and eight hours of grade III (303
and 304). Students exempted from 101 at midyears who are consider-
ing this major should choose another grade II course or a course in
another department in order to take 207, with emphasis on drama, in
the junior year. Course 304 may be devoted mainly to play-writing
by students choosing this major.
Speech: 203, Theatre Workshop (to be taken before the senior year).
General examination: Students taking this major will be examined in
the general examination upon thirty hours of work selected from the
courses listed above.
Students who wish may include other courses in drama in the field of
concentration, e.g., French 212, 213, German 308, Greek 203, 301,
Italian 307, 310, Latin 203, Music 323, Spanish 104, 204, 301, Speech
201, 205.

geography. Students who wish to major in geography will find that
this work correlates well with work in history, economics, and other
social sciences. For advanced work in the subject, both French and
German are useful.
By permission, six hours of closely correlated work in history will be
accepted as part of a major in geography.
The attention of students who are interested in the teaching of geog-
raphy is called to Education 308, The Teaching of Social Studies in the
Secondary School.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
A major offered for the general examination in geology must include
101; that for the general examination in geography must include the
first semester of 101 and 102.
With the possible exception of questions based upon the first semester
of 101, entirely different examinations will be set for the students major-
ing in geology and those majoring in geography. Some choice of
questions will be possible. The questions will test ability to correlate
the subject matter of the various courses covered and to apply the prin-
ciples made familiar through these courses in the interpretation of new
situations and the solution of new problems.
The department will suggest supplementary summer reading for
those students who desire such assistance.

I. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES *
The Department of Hygiene and Physical Education, through its program
adapted to individual needs and abilities, aims to help each student to build up
sufficient strength and vitality to meet the demands of a normally active life;
to appreciate and practice fundamental health habits; to develop a normal
carriage, a sense of rhythm, coördination and motor judgment; to be a coöpera-
tive and contributing participant in group activity; and to acquire skill and
a lasting interest in wholesome forms of recreation.
Four hours in Hygiene and Physical Education are prescribed for the degree.
Two hours are met by 120, Personal Hygiene; the other two hours are met by
two periods per week of physical education activities during freshman and
sophomore years. The activity program of each year is divided into three
seasons.
Sports Requirement: During the two years, the department requires that
students take one season of a team sport and two seasons of an individual sport
(not necessarily the same sport). If a student can demonstrate a fair degree of
skill in an individual sport, or if she has a Junior or Senior Life Saving Certifi-
cate, she may substitute other activities for individual sports.
A student's choice of activity is subject to the approval of the department, on
the basis of the results of the medical and physical examinations, and the stu-
dent's previous experience.

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
A major in Italian is generally based on 101. It is very
It is very desirable
that students majoring in Italian should have had or be taking a col-
lege course in one of the ancient or modern languages, and should
elect such courses in history and art as deal in whole or in part with
Italian civilization and culture. Such courses will be required of
students working for honors.
Students taking a twenty-four-hour major should include 102, 201 or
202 or 207, 301, 304, 306, 307 or 308.
Students taking a thirty-hour major should include 102, 201, 202 or
207, 301, 304, 306, 307 or 308.
NOTE:--101 may not count toward the major.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination for students taking a major in Italian will
be based largely on the work done in the courses of grades II and III,
and will be of such a character as to bring out the interrelation of these
courses, bearing in mind that while some appear to be more closely
articulated than others, they all make their contribution to the cultural

development of Italian life. Some of the questions will have a direct
bearing on the content of the courses, while others will be of a more
general character, and will best be answered by opinions expressed
and deductions drawn.
The results of the elementary work will appear in the degree of ac-
curacy and ease of expression shown in the written portion of the
examination, but especially in translating from English into Italian
and vice versa.

III courses. A reading knowledge of more than one of these languages
is desirable.
Only those students who have completed satisfactorily at least six
hours of grade III in the department will be recommended as teachers
of mathematics.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
Modern mathematics includes fields widely diverse in nature. Work
in each of these fields requires as a basis an understanding of the funda-
mental principles and methods of trigonometry, analytic geometry, and
the differential and integral calculus. On this foundation rests more
advanced work in analysis, geometry, and applied mathematics. The
general examination will include questions on both the fundamental
and the more advanced subjects, with special emphasis on the interrela-
tions between courses.

probable evolutionary sequences. Cells are studied as units of struc-
ture and to demonstrate, particularly in germ-cells, the mechanism of
heredity. In the second semester, lectures and discussions on the
evidence and factors of evolution, on heredity and eugenics.
Open to all undergraduates. Six periods a week, in general two of lecture

DIRECTIONS FOR ELECTION
These courses are designed to provide for the general student a basis
for the interpretation of phenomena in the world of living things. At
the same time they may furnish a foundation for students who plan to
follow professionally some phase of biological work, such as teaching,
research, laboratory technique, medicine, public health, physical educa-
tion, nursing, medical social service.
Five-year Hygiene students wishing to major in the department
should elect 101 in the freshman or sophomore year, and 301, 313, and
302 in the junior and senior years.
Pre-medical students are referred to the requirements as given on
MISS HALL.
page 36.
For public health work, students are advised to elect 101 or 203, 308
and 303 in this department and to include Botany 308 among the
courses related to the major.
A knowledge of Chemistry is required of all students taking work
in Physiology and is desirable for all students majoring in the depart-
ment. A reading knowledge of French and German is desirable,
though not required.
Students majoring in the department may under certain conditions
obtain permission from the Chemistry department to take Chemistry
301 after having taken 101.
GENERAL EXAMINATION
The general examination will test the student's knowledge of the
fundamental principles underlying animal life, the essential facts in-
volved, and their significance. It will also test her ability to correlate
the subject matter of the courses included in her major.
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
Wellesley is a residential college. The conditions of life at Wellesley
are designed to facilitate and supplement the scholar's activity.
THE DEANs are the officers most directly concerned with the organi-
zation of the academic community. In addition to the Dean of In-
struction, the Dean of Students, and the Dean of Residence, there is a
dean for each class. The Dean of Freshmen is ex officio chairman of the
Board of Admission and is, therefore, in a favored position to help en-
tering students take their places in the life of the College. At the be-
ginning of the sophomore year, each class is assigned to a member of the
teaching staff who is relieved from some duties in order to assume re-
sponsibility as the academic adviser for the class during its last three
undergraduate years. The Dean of Students is chairman of the class
deans and is especially responsible for the interpretation of educational
policy to the students. The Dean of Instruction is in charge of those
matters of educational policy and administration which relate es-
pecially to the faculty.
HALLS OF RESIDENCE are maintained for all undergraduates except
those within commuting distance who prefer to live at home. A Head
of House presides over each residence and coöperates with the student
officers to develop the house group as a congenial social unit. Most
of the campus halls have resident faculty members, and other members
of the faculty are frequently entertained in the houses by students.
There are twelve freshman houses. Nine of these are in the village, not
far from the campus, and accommodate more than half the entering
class. Each freshman house has a freshman chairman with a junior as
her adviser. In each of the other campus houses, members of at least
three classes are in residence. Rooms are assigned to new students in
the order in which their original application fees have been received.
RELIGIOUS SERVICES are held daily in the College Chapel. On week
days these are conducted by some member of the faculty, except on
Thursday when a member of the senior class is the leader. The Sun-
day morning services are led by visiting clergymen of many denomina-
tions. In all these services the college choir, led by a member of the
department of Music, participates; and, in addition, there are a number
of special musical vesper services during the year. The Christian
Association conducts a varied program of religious discussions and
conferences, and its officers direct numerous service agencies in the
neighborhood of Wellesley in which many students participate. The
Christian Association coöperates with the student Christian Movement
and is an important link between Wellesley students and those of other
colleges in this country and abroad.
THE Health SERVICE is directed by the college physicians in coöp-
eration with the department of Hygiene and Physical Education. The
154
THE COLLEGE COMMUNITY
155
medical staff includes four physicians, one of whom is a psychiatrist.
One of the physicians is available for visits to student houses, and a
clinic is open without charge to all students at Simpson Infirmary,
where seven trained nurses are in constant attendance. The proximity
of the College to Boston permits frequent conference with other doctors,
and early consultation in case of serious illness is assured. Hospitals in
Boston and Newton are so accessible that immediate care can be given
to any type of illness or accident. In case of serious illness, parents are
notified by telephone or telegram. Seven days of infirmary care are
provided without charge to resident students.
Emphasis is laid on preventive medicine and on the maintenance of
healthy living conditions on the campus. Campus employees are
examined by a college physician, and the doctors coöperate with the
dietitian and purveyor in the selection of food.
The PLACEMENT OFFICE, established by the Founders of the College
as the Teachers' Registry, includes in its scope the placing of seniors
and alumnae in teaching and other professions, and in business, govern-
ment, and industry; the supplying of information about training courses,
apprenticeships, and assistantships; and the arranging of lectures and
discussions on occupations. Registration for placement is open to all
who have taken courses in Wellesley College Students are invited to
register during their senior year but the office is open for conference and
advice to all students. A library of books, pamphlets, current maga-
zine and newspaper articles of vocational interest is maintained and is
available at all times to any interested student or alumna. Additional
information can be secured at any time from members of the Placement
Office staff. The office maintains files, collects credentials, and is the
source of information concerning the vocational equipment and experi-
ence of Wellesley women. The registration fee is two dollars for life
membership, and no commission is charged for placement. The office
also registers undergraduates and alumnae for summer work, and has
charge of undergraduate employment during the school year.
THE COLLEGE GOVERNMENT Association is responsible for the main-
tenance of efficient organization of the undergraduate community. It
is directed largely by students, though it receives its charter from the
Academic Council of the Faculty, which has representatives on its
governing boards. Other student organizations foster a variety of in-
terests: the Athletic Association; the Barnswallows (dramatic) Associa-
tion; the Christian Association; the Forum; the Cosmopolitan Club; the
Poetry Club; and numerous departmental clubs. The Wellesley
College Service Fund is administered by a special committee of faculty
and students which raises and distributes funds for educational and
philanthropic agencies. The largest item in its budget is the annual
contribution to Yenching University in China.
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
(Listed in order of construction)
COLLEGE Hall, the first academic building of Wellesley College, was
the gift of the founders, Mr. and Mrs Henry Fowle Durant. In 1875
it was finished and equipped under the close personal supervision of the
founders. On March 17, 1914, all but one wing of this historic building
was destroyed by fire. That wing, in constant use since 1914, was re-
modeled in 1936 and houses the department of Geology and Geogra-
phy. It is located on the hill overlooking Lake Waban.
Music Hall and BILLINGS HALL are large brick buildings devoted
to the department of Music Music Hall, built in 1880, contains
offices, practice studios, and listening rooms, and includes in its equip-
ment thirty-seven pianos, six victrolas, a recording machine, and a two-
manual organ. The ground floor of Billings Hall (opened in 1904) is
given over to the department offices, two classrooms, and a small audi-
torium. These are equipped with six pianos, a clavichord, a three-
manual organ, two specially built phonographs of rare fidelity in
reproduction, and apparatus for the projection of music on a large il-
luminated screen. The second floor is occupied by the Music Library
and the office of the Research Librarian in Music.
The Music Library contains 4,700 scores, 2,550 reference books on
musical subjects, and 2,700 victrola records, and includes as well a
collection of musical manuscripts which is part of the Hazard Collec-
tion now housed in the treasure room of the main library.
The department has at its disposal the assignment to students of eight
tickets for the weekly concerts of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
Symphony Hall, Boston.
SIMPSON INFIRMARY, a brick building erected in 1881, was used as a
residence hall until 1908. It now provides living quarters for the Resi-
dent Physician and the infirmary staff.
Adjoining this building is a thoroughly modern hospital unit com-
pleted in February, 1942. Besides the doctors' offices and well-
equipped clinic, there are twenty-three patients' bedrooms, lounges,
and a solarium.
THE FARNSWORTH ART BUILDING was the gift of the late Isaac D.
Farnsworth in 1889. It contains lecture rooms and exhibition galleries
and is used by the department of Art for its library, study rooms,
laboratories and studios.
Through the active interest of friends of the College, the Museum
contains a small but representative selection of monuments from differ-
ent periods and styles: Egyptian minor arts; the M. Day Kimball collec-
tion of classical sculpture, including a Polyklitan figure of an athlete;
Græco-Buddhist stucco sculpture from Kashmir; a recently excavated
156

Kolbe; an early Corot; a late Renoir; a small painting by Francesco
Furini; the Cumæan Sibyl by Elihu Vedder; two paintings by Frank
Duveneck; a portrait study by Whistler; and two miniatures by Artemis
Tavshanjian.
THE CHAPEL was presented in 1899 by Miss Elizabeth G. Houghton
and Mr. Clement S. Houghton as a memorial to their father, Mr.
William S. Houghton, a trustee of the College from 1880 to his death in
1894. Its windows include memorials to the Founder of the College
and to various alumnae and members of the faculty. Behind the me-
morial tablet (by Daniel Chester French) in honor of Alice Freeman
Palmer are the urns holding her ashes and those of her husband, Pro-
fessor George Herbert Palmer, trustee of Wellesley College from 1912
to 1933. The three-manual, Aeolian-Skinner organ of ninety-one
stops was dedicated in the fall of 1936.
THE WHITIN OBSERVATORY is a one-story building of brick, faced
with white marble, situated on a small hill on the college grounds and
devoted entirely to the use of the department of Astronomy. THE OB-
SERVATORY HOUSE, the residence of the Director of the Observatory, is
nearby. The Observatory, the House, and much of the astronomical
equipment are gifts of the late Mrs. John C. Whitin.
Mary HEMENWAY Hall, on the western border of the campus, was
erected in 1909 as headquarters of the department of Hygiene and
Physical Education when the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics
became a part of Wellesley College. It contains lecture rooms, labora-
tories, offices, and the library of the department of Hygiene and Physi-
cal Education.
THE LIBRARY of the College, endowed by Eben Norton Horsford,
now numbers over 230,000 bound volumes, including the departmental
libraries. The building of the Main Library was the gift of Andrew
Carnegie. It was opened for use in 1910 and was enlarged to its
present size in 1916, with seating capacity for 539 readers. The books
in the Main Library form a collection chosen primarily for the use of
students and instructors in Literature and Languages, the Social Sci-
ences, Philosophy, Mathematics, Biblical History, and Geography.
The Library is catalogued by author and subject entries, and the most
recent and useful bibliographical aids are provided. Special effort
is made to train students in methods of research.
The Library subscribes for more than one thousand American and
foreign periodicals, including daily newspapers representing different
sections of the United States, besides representative British and Con-
tinental dailies.
The Library has also many special collections of great interest and
value to the student doing graduate or other research work. Among
158
ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
the most valuable of these are the Frances Pearsons Plimpton Collec-
tion of Italian books and manuscripts chiefly of the Renaissance; the
Ruskin Collection; the English Poetry Collection; the Katharine Lee
Bates Collection of Modern Poets; the Laura Hibbard Loomis Collec-
tion of Medieval Literature. With the establishment of the Mayling
Soong Foundation, it is expected that a model undergraduate book
collection will develop for teaching the art, culture, history, and philos-
ophy of the Far East, particularly China.
The Brooks Memorial Room provides comfortable and beautiful
surroundings with carefully selected books for leisure hours of reading.
The following departmental libraries are located in the buildings of
the respective departments: Art, Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Edu-
cation, Geology, Hygiene, Music, Physics, Psychology, and Zoology.
THE PAGE MEMORIAL SCHOOL on the college campus has two small
buildings and is devoted to the education of young children.
FOUNDERS HALL, a building for lecture rooms and department offices
pertaining to instruction in the liberal arts, was opened for use in 1919.
The hall was built from the Restoration Fund, secured for the College
through trustees, faculty, alumnae, and other friends, and replaces in
some part College Hall, the first and main building of the College. The
building is dedicated as a memorial to the Founders of the College.
ALUMNAE HALL, built in 1923 as the gift of the alumnae for a recrea-
tion center, contains an auditorium seating 1,570, a ballroom, a library,
committee rooms for the use of alumnae and students, and full equip-
ment for entertaining. There is also a recreation room, known as “The
Well”, which contains a soda fountain, tables for light refreshments,
and a nickelodeon.
SAGE HALL was built to house the departments of Botany and Zool-
ogy and Physiology. The first unit for the department of Botany was
erected in 1927, and the Zoology and Physiology unit in 1931. The
principal donor was Mrs. Russell Sage.
HETTY H. R. GREEN HALL, the administration building, was in large
part the gift of Mrs. Green's son and daughter, Colonel Edward H. R.
Green and Mrs. Matthew A. Wilks. It contains the administrative
offices, class and seminar rooms, the faculty assembly hall, and offices of
student organizations. The Galen L. Stone Tower, named for its
donor, contains a carillon which was the gift of Mrs. Charlotte Nichols
Greene.
PENDLETON Hall was opened in 1935. It was named at the request
of the undergraduates in honor of Ellen Fitz Pendleton, President
of the College from 1911 to 1936. This fire-proof building houses the
departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology.
THE RECREATION BUILDING, containing the GEORGE HOWE DAVEN-
PORT SWIMMING POOL, was opened in March, 1939. It is the gift of

many donors, two of whom, Mr. and Mrs. Davenport, gave large sums.
This building has many facilities, including squash and badminton
courts, and is used for the indoor activities of the physical education
classes. It also serves as a recreation center for students, faculty, ad-
ministration, alumnae, and their guests.

sion, and no application is recorded until the fee is received. The same
fee is required from all former students who apply for readmission.

cancelled for any reason, by the candidate or the College, the fee is for-
feited to the College. A student who postpones entrance until the year
following the one for which she first applied may transfer her applica-
tion fec.

Arrangements for a group student health and accident insurance
policy are made by the College with a reputable insurance company.

together with the benefits of the group student health and accident in-
surance, should meet the greater part of the necessary medical expenses
ordinarily incurred at the College. Details in regard to this insurance
will be mailed with first semester bills by the Assistant Treasurer, who
will be glad to answer questions about it. This insurance is strongly
recommended to students, but is not a requirement.

table and a comfortable chair are permissible additions. They may also
bring radios, record players, clocks, and additional lamps upon the
payment of $1.00 a year for each piece of electrical equipment.
A student who leaves personal possessions in the house does so at her
own risk. Articles remaining unclaimed for more than one year after a student
has left college, either by withdrawal or graduation, will be disposed of by the
College.
SCHOLARSHIPS
Scholarships maintained by income from permanent funds are
awarded annually to undergraduate students, and grants are made
from other funds which the trustees set aside for this purpose each year.
The students who qualify for these scholarships are, in the main, those
who have been in Wellesley College at least a year, but there are also
various awards for freshmen who have promising credentials and who
need some financial help in order to come to college. Awards are made
in recognition of intellectual ability, of good college citizenship and
character, and of genuine financial need. The size of the scholarships
ranges in general from $100 to $500. There are a few larger scholar-
ships for foreign students.
Applications from students in college must be filed with the Dean of
Students, who is Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Scholarships,
on forms furnished for the purpose and in accordance with the instruc-
tions posted near the close of the first semester.
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR FRESHMEN:
A limited number of scholarships are offered to incoming freshmen.
Awards are based on financial need and on credentials which give
promise of academic success and good college citizenship. The largest
awards available to freshmen are the Pendleton Scholarships of $600,
named in honor of Ellen Fitz Pendleton who was President of Wellesley
College from 1911 to 1936. There are fifteen of these scholarships,
eight of which are granted on a regional basis: one in New England, one
in the Middle Atlantic States, two in the South, two in the Central
States, and two in the Far West. The remaining seven are open to
students from all parts of the country. As funds permit, sums ranging
from $100 to $400 are awarded to other freshman applicants.
Applications from all candidates for admission should be made to
the Dean of Freshmen before March 1 of the year of admission. More
detailed information about scholarships may be obtained from the
Dean of Freshmen,
Wellesley College is a member of the Seven College Conference
which has established National Honor Scholarships for Women. These
scholarships may be competed for by students from the three following
districts: Middle West, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; South, Louisiana,
New Mexico, Texas; West, California, Oregon, Washington. Infor-
mation about these scholarships may be obtained by writing to Mrs. F.
Murray Forbes, Jr., Executive Secretary, Committee on National
Scholarships for Women, 21 Beaver Place, Boston 8, Massachusetts.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT:
The Placement Office offers assistance to students who wish to earn
money toward their college expenses. The types of employment arę
163
164
SCHOLARSHIPS
mainly caring for children, clerical work, library work, assisting in the
various offices of the College, and some domestic work. Within the
College three exchanges dealing in furniture, books, and food, also
newspaper, Railway Express, and dry-cleaning agencies afford regular
work for a number of students. While the Placement Office makes
every effort to obtain places for those who wish to work, it cautions
students against depending upon this source for any considerable in-
come. Such employment makes a distinct draft upon strength and
time, and it is hardly to be advised for the freshman year.
THE WELLESLEY STUDENTS' AID SOCIETY:
This organization is maintained by alumnae and former students of
the College, aided by the faculty and undergraduates, as their contribu-
tion toward keeping the opportunities of Wellesley open to students of
moderate means. Awards are made in some combination of gift and
loan to supplement college scholarships, and are made on practically
the same basis as college grants. They ordinarily range from $50 to
$200. Loans and occasionally gifts in small sums, $5 to $25, are also
made for incidental expenses and emergencies.

HONOR SCHOLARSHIPS
Honor Scholarships (without stipend) have been established by the College
for the purpose of giving recognition to a high degree of excellence in academic
work. These honors fall into two classes: students in the first, or higher class,
are termed Durant Scholars; students in the second class are termed Wellesley
College Scholars.
These honors are awarded to seniors on the basis of two and one-half years'
work, to juniors on the basis of one and one-half years' work. The standard in
each case is absolute, not competitive.
